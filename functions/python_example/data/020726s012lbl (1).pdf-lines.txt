CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
26
Mechanism of Action
27
The growth of some cancers of the breast is stimulated or maintained by estrogens. Treatment
28
of breast cancer thought to be hormonally responsive (i.e., estrogen and/or progesterone
29
receptor positive or receptor unknown) has included a variety of efforts to decrease estrogen
30
levels
(ovariectomy,
adrenalectomy,
hypophysectomy)
or
inhibit
estrogen
effects
31
(antiestrogens and progestational agents). These interventions lead to decreased tumor mass
32
or delayed progression of tumor growth in some women.
33
In postmenopausal women, estrogens are mainly derived from the action of the
34
aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens (primarily androstenedione and
35 testosterone) to estrone and estradiol. The suppression of estrogen biosynthesis in peripheral
36
tissues and in the cancer tissue itself can therefore be achieved by specifically inhibiting the
37
aromatase enzyme.
38
Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme system; it
39 inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens In adult nontumor- and tumor-bearing
40
female animals, letrozole is as effective as ovariectomy in reducing uterine weight, elevating
41
serum LH, and causing the regression of estrogen-dependent tumors. In contrast to
42
ovariectomy, treatment with letrozole does not lead to an increase in serum FSH. Letrozole
43
selectively inhibits gonadal steroidogenesis but has no significant effect on adrenal
44
mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid synthesis.
45
Letrozole inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the heme of the
46
cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen biosynthesis in
47
all tissues. Treatment of women with letrozole significantly lowers serum estrone, estradiol
48 and estrone sulfate and has not been shown to significantly affect adrenal corticosteroid
49
synthesis, aldosterone synthesis, or synthesis of thyroid hormones.
50 Pharmacokinetics
51
Letrozole is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and absorption is
52 not affected by food. It is metabolized slowly to an inactive metabolite whose glucuronide
53
conjugate is excreted renally, representing the major clearance pathway. About 90% of
54
radiolabeled letrozole is recovered in urine. Letrozole's terminal elimination half-life is about
55
2 days and steady-state plasma concentration after daily 2.5 mg dosing is reached in 2-6
56
weeks. Plasma concentrations at steady-state are 1.5 to 2 times higher than predicted from the
57 concentrations measured after a single dose, indicating a slight non-linearity in the
58
pharmacokinetics of letrozole upon daily administration of 2.5 mg. These steady-state levels
59
are maintained over extended periods, however, and continuous accumulation of letrozole
60
does not occur. Letrozole is weakly protein bound and has a large volume of distribution
61
(approximately 1.9 L/kg).
62
Metabolism and Excretion
63
Metabolism to a pharmacologically-inactive carbinol metabolite (4,4'-methanol-
64
bisbenzonitrile) and renal excretion of the glucuronide conjugate of this metabolite is the
65
major pathway of letrozole clearance. Of the radiolabel recovered in urine, at least 75% was
Page 3
66
the glucuronide of the carbinol metabolite, about 9% was two unidentified metabolites, and
67
6% was unchanged letrozole.
68
In human microsomes with specific CYP isozyme activity, CYP3A4 metabolized
69
letrozole to the carbinol metabolite while CYP2A6 formed both this metabolite and its ketone
70
analog. In human liver microsomes, letrozole strongly inhibited CYP2A6 and moderately
71
inhibited CYP2C19.
72
Special Populations
73
Pediatric, Geriatric and Race
74
In the study populations (adults ranging in age from 35 to >80 years), no change in
75
pharmacokinetic parameters was observed with increasing age. Differences in letrozole
76
pharmacokinetics between adult and pediatric populations have not been studied. Differences
77
in letrozole pharmacokinetics due to race have not been studied.
78
Renal Insufficiency
79
In a study of volunteers with varying renal function (24-hour creatinine clearance:
80
9-116 mL/min), no effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of 2.5 mg
81
of Femara (letrozole tablets) was found. In addition, in a study of 347 patients with advanced
82
breast cancer, about half of whom received 2.5 mg Femara and half 0.5 mg Femara, renal
83
impairment (calculated creatinine clearance: 20-50 mL/min) did not affect steady-state plasma
84
letrozole concentration.
85
Hepatic Insufficiency
86
In a study of subjects with mild to moderate non-metastatic hepatic dysfunction
87
(e.g., cirrhosis, Child-Pugh classification A and B), the mean AUC values of the volunteers
88
with moderate hepatic impairment were 37% higher than in normal subjects, but still within
89 the range seen in subjects without impaired function. In a pharmacokinetics study, subjects
90
with liver cirrhosis and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification C, which
91
included bilirubins about 2-11 times ULN with minimal to severe ascites) had two-fold
92
increase in exposure (AUC) and 47% reduction in systemic clearance. Breast cancer patients
93
with severe hepatic impairment are thus expected to be exposed to higher levels of letrozole
94
than patients with normal liver function receiving similar doses of this drug (See DOSAGE
95
AND ADMINISTRATION, Hepatic Impairment.)
96
Drug/Drug Interactions
97
A pharmacokinetic interaction study with cimetidine showed no clinically significant effect
98
on letrozole pharmacokinetics. An interaction study with warfarin showed no clinically
99
significant effect of letrozole on warfarin pharmacokinetics. In in-vitro experiments, letrozole
100
showed no significant inhibition in the metabolism of diazepam. Similarly, no significant
101
inhibition of letrozole metabolism by diazepam was observed.
102
Coadministration of Femara and tamoxifen 20 mg daily resulted in a reduction of
103
letrozole plasma levels of 38% on average. Clinical experience in the second-line breast
Page 4
104
cancer pivotal trials indicates that the therapeutic effect of Femara therapy is not impaired if
105
Femara is administered immediately after tamoxifen.
106
There is no clinical experience to date on the use of Femara in combination with other
107
anticancer agents.
108
Pharmacodynamics
109
In postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer, daily doses of 0.1 mg to 5 mg
110
Femara suppress plasma concentrations of estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate by 75%-95%
111
from baseline with maximal suppression achieved within two-three days. Suppression is dose-
112
related, with doses of 0.5 mg and higher giving many values of estrone and estrone sulfate
113
that were below the limit of detection in the assays. Estrogen suppression was maintained
114
throughout treatment in all patients treated at 0.5 mg or higher.
115
Letrozole is highly specific in inhibiting aromatase activity. There is no impairment
116
of adrenal steroidogenesis. No clinically-relevant changes were found in the plasma
117
concentrations of cortisol, aldosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 17-hydroxy-progesterone, ACTH or
118
in plasma renin activity among postmenopausal patients treated with a daily dose of Femara
119
0.1 mg to 5 mg. The ACTH stimulation test performed after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment with
120
daily doses of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mg did not indicate any attenuation of aldosterone
121
or cortisol production. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid supplementation is, therefore, not
122
necessary.
123
No changes were noted in plasma concentrations of androgens (androstenedione and
124
testosterone) among healthy postmenopausal women after 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mg single doses of
125
Femara or in plasma concentrations of androstenedione among postmenopausal patients
126
treated with daily doses of 0.1 mg to 5 mg. This indicates that the blockade of estrogen
127
biosynthesis does not lead to accumulation of androgenic precursors. Plasma levels of LH and
128
FSH were not affected by letrozole in patients, nor was thyroid function as evaluated by TSH
129
levels, T3 uptake, and T4 levels.

134
A. tamoxifen for 5 years
135
B. Femara for 5 years
136
C. tamoxifen for 2 years followed by Femara for 3 years
137
D. Femara for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years
138
139
Median treatment duration was 24 months, median follow-up duration was 26 months, 76% of
140
the patients have been followed for more than 2 years, and 16% of patients for 5 years or
141
longer.

Extended Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women After
174
Completion of 5 Years of Adjuvant Tamoxifen Therapy.
175
A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Femara was performed in over 5100
176
postmenopausal women with receptor-positive or unknown primary breast cancer who were
177
disease-free after 5 years of adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen. Patients had to be within 3
178
months of completing the 5 years of tamoxifen.
179
The planned duration of treatment for patients in the study was 5 years, but the trial
180
was terminated early because of an interim analysis showing a favorable Femara effect on
181
time without recurrence or contralateral breast cancer. At the time of unblinding, women had
Page 7
182
been followed for a median of 28 months, 30% of patients had completed 3 or more years of
183
follow-up and less than 1% of patients had completed 5 years of follow-up.

325
The median overall survival was 35 months for the Femara group and 32 months for
326
the tamoxifen group, with a P value 0.5136.
327
Study design allowed patients to crossover upon progression to the other therapy.
328
Approximately 50% of patients crossed over to the opposite treatment arm and almost all
329
patients who crossed over had done SO by 36 months. The median time to crossover was 17
330
months (Femara to tamoxifen) and 13 months (tamoxifen to Femara). In patients who did not
331
crossover to the opposite treatment arm, median survival was 35 months with Femara (n-219,
332
95% Cl 29 to 43 months) VS. 20 months with tamoxifen (n-229, 95% Cl 16 to 26 months).
333
Second-Line Breast Cancer
334
Femara was initially studied at doses of 0.1 mg to 5.0 mg daily in six non-comparative Phase
335
I/II trials in 181 postmenopausal estrogen/progesterone receptor positive or unknown
336
advanced breast cancer patients previously treated with at least anti-estrogen therapy Patients
337
had received other hormonal therapies and also may have received cytotoxic therapy. Eight
338
(20%) of forty patients treated with Femara 2.5 mg daily in Phase I/II trials achieved an
339
objective tumor response (complete or partial response).
340
Two large randomized controlled multinational (predominantly European) trials were
341
conducted in patients with advanced breast cancer who had progressed despite antiestrogen
342
therapy Patients were randomized to Femara 0.5 mg daily, Femara 2.5 mg daily, or a
343
comparator (megestrol acetate 160 mg daily in one study; and aminoglutethimide 250 mg
Page 12
344
b.i.d. with corticosteroid supplementation in the other study). In each study over 60% of the
345
patients had received therapeutic antiestrogens, and about one-fifth of these patients had had
346
an objective response. The megestrol acetate controlled study was double-blind; the other
347
study was open label. Selected baseline characteristics for each study are shown in Table 10.

365
All responses were confirmed by a second evaluation 4-12 weeks after the documentation of
366
the initial response.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE
425
Femara R (letrozole tablets) is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women
426
with hormone receptor positive early breast cancer (see CLINICAL STUDIES).
427
The effectiveness of Femara in early breast cancer is based on an analysis of disease-
428
free survival in patients treated for a median of 24 months and followed for a median of 26
429
months (see CLINICAL STUDIES) Follow up analyses will determine long-term outcomes
430
for both safety and efficacy.
431
Femara is indicated for the extended adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer in
432
postmenopausal women who have received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy (see
433
CLINICAL STUDIES). The effectiveness of Femara in extended adjuvant treatment of early
434
breast cancer is based on an analysis of disease-free survival in patients treated for a median
435
of 24 months (see CLINICAL STUDIES). Further data will be required to determine long-
436
term outcome.
437
Femara is indicated for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone
438
receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
439
Femara is also indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal
440
women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy.
Page 15
441
CONTRAINDICATIONS
442
Femara (letrozole tablets) is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to
443
Femara or any of its excipients.
444 WARNINGS
445 Pregnancy
446
Femara may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Studies in rats at doses
447
equal to or greater than 0.003 mg/kg (about 1/100 the daily maximum recommended human
448
dose on a mg/m2 basis) administered during the period of organogenesis, have shown that
449 letrozole is embryotoxic and fetotoxic, as indicated by intrauterine mortality, increased
450
resorption, increased postimplantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses and fetal
451
anomalies including absence and shortening of renal papilla, dilation of ureter, edema and
452 incomplete ossification of frontal skull and metatarsals. Letrozole was teratogenic in rats A
453
0.03 mg/kg dose (about 1/10 the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2
454
basis) caused fetal domed head and cervical/centrum vertebral fusion.
455
Letrozole is embryotoxic at doses equal to or greater than 0.002 mg/kg and fetotoxic
456
when administered to rabbits at 0.02 mg/kg (about 1/100,000 and 1/10,000 the daily
457
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m basis, respectively). Fetal anomalies
458
included incomplete ossification of the skull, sternebrae, and fore- a and hindlegs
459
There are no studies in pregnant women. Femara" (letrozole tablets) is indicated for
460
postmenopausal women. If there is exposure to letrozole during pregnancy, the patient should
461
be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and potentia risk for loss of the pregnancy.
462
PRECAUTIONS
463
Since fatigue and dizziness have been observed with the use of Femara (letrozole tablets)
464
and somnolence was uncommonly reported, caution is advised when driving or using
465 machinery.
466
Laboratory Tests
467
No dose-related effect of Femara on any hematologic or clinical chemistry parameter was
468
evident. Moderate decreases in lymphocyte counts, of uncertain clinical significance, were
469
observed in some patients receiving Femara 2.5 mg. This depression was transient in about
470
half of those affected. Two patients on Femara developed thrombocytopenia; relationship to
471
the study drug was unclear. Patient withdrawal due to laboratory abnormalities, whether
472
related to study treatment or not, was infrequent.
473
Increases in SGOT, SGPT, and gamma GT >5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
474
and of bilirubin >1.5 times the ULN were most often associated with metastatic disease in the
475
liver. About 3% of study participants receiving Femara had abnormalities in liver chemistries
476
not associated with documented metastases; these abnormalities may have been related to
477
study drug therapy. In the megestrol acetate comparative study about 8% of patients treated
478
with megestrol acetate had abnormalities in liver chemistries that were not associated with
Page 16
479
documented liver metastases; in the aminoglutethimide study about 10% of
480
aminoglutethimide-treated patients had abnormalities in liver chemistries not associated with
481
hepatic metastases.
482
In the adjuvant setting, an increase in total cholesterol (generally non-fasting) in
483 patients who had baseline values of total serum cholesterol within the normal range, and then
484
subsequently had an increase in total serum cholesterol of 1.5 ULN was 173/3203 (5.4%) on
485
letrozole VS. 40/3224 (1.2%) on tamoxifen. Lipid lowering medications were used by 18% of
486
patients on letrozole and 12% on tamoxifen.
487
488
Bone Effects
489
In the extended adjuvant setting, preliminary results (median duration of follow-up was 20
490
months) from the bone sub-study (Calcium 500 mg and Vitamin D 400 IU per day mandatory;
491
bisphosphonates not allowed) demonstrated that at 2 years the mean decrease compared to
492
baseline in hip BMD in Femara patients was 3% versus 0.4% for placebo (P-0.048). The
493
mean decrease from baseline BMD results for the lumbar spine at 2 years was Femara 4.6%
494
decrease and placebo 2.2% (P=0.069). Consideration should be given to monitoring BMD.
495
Drug Interactions
496
Clinical interaction studies with cimetidine and warfarin indicated that the coadministration of
497
Femara with these drugs does not result in clinically-significant drug interactions. (See
498
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.)
499
Coadministration of Femara and tamoxifen 20 mg daily resulted in a reduction of
500
letrozole plasma levels by 38% on average. There is no clinical experience to date on the use
501
of Femara in combination with other anticancer agents.
502
Hepatic Insufficiency
503
Subjects with cirrhosis and severe hepatic dysfunction (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,
504
Special Populations) who were dosed with 2.5 mg of Femara experienced approximately
505
twice the exposure to Femara as healthy volunteers with normal liver function. Therefore, a
506
dose reduction is recommended for this patient population The effect of hepatic impairment
507
on Femara exposure in cancer patients with elevated bilirubin levels has not been determined.
508
(See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
509
Drug/Laboratory Test-Interactions
510
None observed.
511
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
512
A conventional carcinogenesis study in mice at doses of 0.6 to 60 mg/kg/day (about one to
513
100 times the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m basis) administered by
514
oral gavage for up to 2 years revealed a dose-related increase in the incidence of benign
515
ovarian stromal tumors. The incidence of combined hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma
516
showed a significant trend in females when the high dose group was excluded due to low
517
survival. In a separate study, plasma AUCo-12hr levels in mice at 60 mg/kg/day were 55 times
Page 17
518 higher than the AUC-24hr level in breast cancer patients at the recommended dose. The
519
carcinogenicity study in rats at oral doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (about 0.4 to 40 times the
520
daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m basis) for up to 2 years also produced
521
an increase in the incidence of benign ovarian stromal tumors at 10 mg/kg/day. Ovarian
522
hyperplasia was observed in females at doses equal to or greater than 0.1 mg/kg/day At
523
10 mg/kg/day, plasma AUC-24hr levels in rats were 80 times higher than the level in breast
524
cancer patients at the recommended dose.
525
Femara was not mutagenic in in vitro tests (Ames and E.coli bacterial tests) but was
526
observed to be a potential clastogen in in vitro assays (CHO K1 and CCL 61 Chinese hamster
527
ovary cells). Letrozole was not clastogenic in vivo (micronucleus test in rats).
528
Studies to investigate the effect of letrozole on fertility have not been conducted;
529
however, repeated dosing caused sexual inactivity in females and atrophy of the reproductive
530
tract in males and females at doses of 0.6, 0.1 and 0.03 mg/kg in mice, rats and dogs,
531
respectively (about one, 0.4 and 0.4 the daily maximum recommended human dose on a
532
mg/m basis, respectively).
533 Pregnancy
534
Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS).
535
Nursing Mothers
536
It is not known if letrozole is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in
537
human milk, caution should be exercised when letrozole is administered to a nursing woman
538
(see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS)
539
Pediatric Use
540
The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.
541
Geriatric Use
542
The median age of patients in all studies of first-line and second-line treatment of metastatic
543
breast cancer was 64-65 years. About 1/3 of the patients were >70 years old. In the first-line
544
study patients >70 years of age experienced longer time to tumor progression and higher
545
response rates than patients <70.
546
For the extended adjuvant setting, more than 5100 postmenopausal women were
547
enrolled in the clinical study. In total, 41% of patients were aged 65 years or older at
548
enrollment, while 12% were 75 or older. In the extended adjuvant setting, no overall
549
differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these older patients and younger
550
patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses
551
between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals
552
cannot be ruled out.
553
In the adjuvant setting, more than 8000 postmenopausal women were enrolled in the
554
clinical study. In total, 36 % of patients were aged 65 years or older at enrollment, while 12%
555
were 75 or older. More adverse events were generally reported in elderly patients irrespective
556
of study treatment allocation. However, in comparison to tamoxifen, no overall differences
Page 18
557
with regards to the safety and efficacy profiles were observed between elderly patients and
558
younger patients
559
ADVERSE REACTIONS
560
Femara R (letrozole tablets) was generally well tolerated across all studies in first-line and
561
second-line metastatic breast cancer, adjuvant treatment, as well as extended adjuvant
562
treatment in women who have received prior adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Generally, the
563
observed adverse reactions are mild or moderate in nature.
564
Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer in Postmenopausa women
565
The median duration of adjuvant treatment was 24 months and the median duration of follow-
566
up for safety was 26 months for patients receiving Femara and tamoxifen.
567
Certain adverse events were prospectively specified for analysis, based on the known
568
pharmacologic properties and side effect profiles of the two drugs.
569
Adverse events were analyzed irrespective of whether a symptom was present or
570
absent at baseline. Most adverse events reported (82%) were grade 1 or grade 2 applying the
571
Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0. Table 13 describes adverse events (grades 1-4)
572
irrespective of relationship to study treatment in the adjuvant BIG 1-98 trial (safety
573
population, during treatment or within 30 days of stopping treatment).

When considering all grades, a higher incidence of events was seen for Femara regarding
578
fractures (5.7% VS. 4%), myocardia infarctions (0.6% VS. 0.4%), and arthralgia (21.2% VS.
579
13.5%) (Femara VS. tamoxifen respectively). A higher incidence was seen for tamoxifen
580
regarding thromboembolic events (1.2% VS. 2.8%), endometrial cancer (0.2% VS. 0.4%), and
581
endometrial proliferative disorders (0.3% VS. 1.8%) (Femara VS. tamoxifen respectively).

595
The duration of follow-up for both the main clinical study and the bone study were
596
insufficient to assess fracture risk associated with long-term use of Femara. Based on a
597
median follow-up of patients for 28 months, the incidence of clinical fractures from the core
598
randomized study in patients who received Femara was 5.9% (152) and placebo was 5.5%
599
(142). The incidence of self-reported osteoporosis was higher in patients who received
600
Femara 6.9% (176) than in patients who received placebo 5.5% (141). Bisphosphonates were
601
administered to 21.1% of the patients who received Femara and 18.7% of the patients who
602
received placebo.
603
Preliminary results (median duration of follow-up was 20 months) from the bone sub-
604
study (Calcium 500 mg and Vitamin D 400 IU per day mandatory; bisphosphonates not
605
allowed) demonstrated that at 2 years the mean decrease compared to baseline in hip BMD in
606
Femara patients was 3% versus 0.4% for placebo. The mean decrease from baseline BMD
607
results for the lumbar spine at 2 years were Femara 4.6% decrease and placebo 2.2%.
608
The incidence of cardiovascular ischemic events from the core randomized study was
609
comparable between patients who received Femara 6.8% (175) and placebo 6.5% (167).
610
Preliminary results (median duration of follow-up was 30 months) from the lipid sub-
611
study did not show significant differences between the Femara and placebo groups. The
Page 21
612
HDL:LDL ratio decreased after the first 6 months of therapy but the decrease was similar in
613
both groups and no statistically significant differences were detected.
614
A patient-reported measure that captures treatment impact on important symptoms associated
615
with estrogen deficiency demonstrated a difference in favour of placebo for vasomotor and
616
sexual symptom domains."
617
First-Line Breast Cancer
618
A total of 455 patients was treated for a median time of exposure of 11 months. The incidence
619
of adverse experiences was similar for Femara and tamoxifen. The most frequently reported
620
adverse experiences were bone pain, hot flushes, back pain, nausea, arthralgia and dyspnea.
621
Discontinuations for adverse experiences other than progression of tumor occurred in 10/455
622
(2%) of patients on Femara and in 15/455 (3%) of patients on tamoxifen.
623
Adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least
624
5% of the patients treated with Femara 2.5 mg or tamoxifen 20 mg in the first-line treatment
625
study are shown in Table 15.

Other less frequent (<2%) adverse experiences considered consequential for both
671
treatment groups, included peripheral thromboembolic events, cardiovascular events, and
672
cerebrovascular events. Peripheral thromboembolic events included venous thrombosis,
673
thrombophlebitis, portal vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Cardiovascular events
674
included angina, myocardia infarction, myocardia ischemia, and coronary heart disease.
675
Cerebrovascular events included transient ischemic attacks, thrombotic or hemorrhagic
676
strokes and development of hemiparesis.

Second-Line Breast Cancer
678
Femara was generally well tolerated in two controlled clinical trials
679
Study discontinuations in the megestrol acetate comparison study for adverse events
680
other than progression of tumor 5/188 (2.7%) on Femara 0.5 mg, in 4/174 (2.3%) on Femara
681
2.5 mg, and in 15/190 (7.9%) on megestrol acetate. There were fewer thromboembolic events
682
at both Femara doses than on the megestrol acetate arm (0.6% VS. 4.7%). There was also less
683
vaginal bleeding (0.3% VS. 3.2%) on Femara than on megestrol acetate. In the
684
aminoglutethimide comparison study, discontinuations for reasons other than progression
685
occurred in 6/193 (3.1%) on 0.5 mg Femara, 7/185 (3.8%) on 2.5 mg Femara, and 7/178 of
686
patients on (3.9%) of patients on aminoglutethimide.
687
Comparisons of the incidence of adverse events revealed no significant differences
688
between the high and low dose Femara groups in either study. Most of the adverse events
689
observed in all treatment groups were mild to moderate in severity and it was generally not
690
possible to distinguish adverse reactions due to treatment from the consequences of the
691
patient's metastatic breast cancer, the effects of estrogen deprivation, or intercurrent illness.
692
Adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least
693
5% of the patients treated with Femara 0.5 mg, Femara 2.5 mg, megestrol acetate, or
694
aminoglutethimide in the two controlled trials are shown in Table 16.

Post-Marketing Experiences
743
Cases of blurred vision and increased hepatic enzyme have been uncommonly (<1%) reported

745
OVERDOSAGE
746
Isolated cases of Femara R (letrozole tablets) overdose have been reported In these instances,
747
the highest single dose ingested was 62.5 mg or 25 tablets. While no serious adverse events
748
were reported in these cases, because of the limited data available, no firm recommendations
749
for treatment can be made. However, emesis could be induced if the patient is alert. In
750
general, supportive care and frequent monitoring of vital signs are also appropriate In single
751
dose studies the highest dose used was 30 mg, which was well tolerated; in multiple dose
752
trials, the largest dose of 10 mg was well tolerated.
Page 24
753
Lethality was observed in mice and rats following single oral doses that were equal to
754 or greater than 2000 mg/kg (about 4000 to 8000 times the daily maximum recommended
755
human dose on a mg/m basis); death was associated with reduced motor activity, ataxia and
756
dyspnea. Lethality was observed in cats following single IV doses that were equal to or
757
greater than 10 mg/kg (about 50 times the daily maximum recommended human dose on a
758
mg/m basis); death was preceded by depressed blood pressure and arrhythmias.
759
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
760
Adult and Elderly Patients
761
The recommended dose of Femara (letrozole tablets) is one 2.5 mg tablet administered once
762
a day, without regard to meals. In patients with advanced disease, treatment with Femara
763
should continue until tumor progression is evident.
764
In the extended adjuvant setting, the optimal treatment duration with Femara is not known.
765
The planned duration of treatment in the study was 5 years. However, at the time of the
766 analysis, the median treatment duration was 24 months, 25% of patients were treated for at
767
least 3 years and less than 1% of patients were treated for the planned duration of 5 years.
768
The median duration of follow-up was 28 months. Treatment should be discontinued at tumor
769
relapse (see CLINICAL STUDIES).
770
771
In the adjuvant setting, the optimal duration of treatment with letrozole is unknown. The
772
planned duration of treatment in the study is 5 years. However, at the time of analysis, the
773
median duration of treatment was 24 months, median duration of follow-up was 26 months,
774
and 16% of the patients have been treated for 5 years. Treatment should be discontinued at
775
relapse. (see CLINICAL STUDIES).
776
777
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients. Patients treated with Femara do not
778
require glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacement therapy.
779
Renal Impairment
780
(See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.) No dosage adjustment is required for patients with
781
renal impairment if creatinine clearance is >10 mL/min.
782
Hepatic Impairment
783
No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic
784
impairment, although Femara blood concentrations were modestly increased in subjects with
785
moderate hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis. The dose of Femara in patients with cirrhosis
786
and severe hepatic dysfunction should be reduced by 50% (see CLINICAL
787 PHARMACOLOGY). The recommended dose of Femara (letrozole tablets) for such patients
788
is 2.5 mg administered every other day. The effect of hepatic impairment on Femara exposure
789
in noncirrhotic cancer patients with elevated bilirubin levels has not been determined. (See
790
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.)
