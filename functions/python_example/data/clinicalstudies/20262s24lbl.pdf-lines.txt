Ovarian Carcinoma
First-Line Data: The safety and efficacy of TAXOL (135 mg/m2 over 24 hr) in combination with cisplatin (75 mg/m2) in
3
patients with advanced ovarian cancer and no prior chemotherapy were evaluated in a Phase 3 multicenter,
randomized, controlled (vs cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2) clinica trial conducted by the
Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG). A total of 410 patients with Stage III or IV disease (>1 cm residual disease after
staging laparotomy or distant metastases) were randomized. Patients treated with TAXOL in combination with
cisplatin had significantly longer time to progression (median 16.6 VS. 13.0 months, p=0.0008) and nearly a year
longer median survival time (p=0.0002) compared with standard therapy

The adverse event profile for patients receiving TAXOL in combination with cisplatin in this study was generally
consistent with that seen for the pooled analysis performed on data from 812 patients treated with single-agent
TAXOL in 10 clinical studies. These adverse events and adverse events from the phase 3 first-line ovarian
TAXOL in 10 clinical studies. These adverse events and adverse events from the phase 3 first-line ovarian
carcinoma study are described in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of the label, in tabular (Table 8 & 9) and
narrative form.

Second-Line Data: Data from five Phase 1 & 2 clinical studies (189 patients), a multicenter randomized Phase 3 study
(407 patients) as well as an interim analysis of data from more than 300 patients enrolled in a treatment referral
center program were used in support of the use of TAXOL in patients who have failed initia or subsequent
chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoma of the ovary. Two of the Phase 2 studies (92 patients) utilized an initia dose
of 135 to 170 mg/m2 in most patients (>90%) administered over 24 hours by continuous infusion. Response rates in
these two studies were 22% (95% Cl: 11% to 37%) and 30% (95% Cl: 18% to 46%) with a total of six complete and
18 partia responses in 92 patients. The median duration of overall response in these two studies measured from the
first day of treatment was 7.2 months (range: 3.5-15.8 months) and 7.5 months (range: 5.3-17.4 months)
respectively. The median survival was 8.1 months (range: 0.2-36.7 months) and 15.9 months (range: 1.8-34.5 +
months).
The Phase 3 study had a bifactorial design and compared the efficacy and safety of TAXOL, administered at
two different doses (135 or 175 mg/m2) and schedules (3- or 24-hour infusion). The overall response rate for the 407
patients was 16.2% (95% Cl: 12.8% to 20.2%), with 6 complete and 60 partia responses Duration of response,
measured from the first day of treatment was 8.3 months (range: 3.2-21.6 months). Median time to progression was
3.7 months (range 0.1+ - 25.1+ months). Median surviva was 11.5 months (range: 0.2-26.3 + months).
Response rates, median survival and median time to progression for the 4 arms are given in the following

Analyses were performed as planned by the bifactorial study design described in the protocol, by comparing
the two doses (135 or 175 mg/m2) irrespective of the schedule (3 or 24 hours) and the two schedules irrespective of
dose. Patients receiving the 175 mg/m2 dose had a response rate similar to that for those receiving the 135 mg/m2
dose: 18% VS. 14% (p=0.28). No difference in response rate was detected when comparing the 3-hour with the 24-
hour infusion: 15% VS. 17% (p=0.50). Patients receiving the 175 mg/m2 dose of TAXOL had a longer time to
progression than those receiving the 135 mg/m2 dose: median 4.2 VS. 3.1 months (p=0.03). There was no statistically
significant difference in time to progression for patients receiving the 3-hour VS. the 24-hour infusion: 4.0 months VS.
3.7 months (p=0.08). Median survival was 11.6 months in patients receiving the 175 mg/m2 dose of TAXOL and 11.0
months in patients receiving the 135 mg/m2 dose (p=0.92). Median survival was 11.7 months for patients receiving
the 3-hour infusion of TAXOL and 11.2 months for patients receiving the 24-hour infusion (p=0.91). These statistical
analyses should be viewed with caution because of the multiple comparisons made.
TAXOL remained active in patients who had developed resistance to platinum-containing therapy (defined
as tumor progression while on, or tumor relapse within 6 months from completion of, a platinum containing regimen)
with response rates of 14% in the Phase 3 study and 31% in the Phase 1 & 2 clinical studies.
The adverse event profile in this Phase 3 study was generally consistent with that seen for the pooled
analysis performed on data from 812 patients treated in ten clinical studies. These adverse events and adverse
analysis performed on data from 812 patients treated in ten clinical studies. These adverse events and adverse
events from the phase 3 second-line ovarian carcinoma study are described in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of
the label, in tabular (Table 8 & 10) and narrative form.
The results of this randomized study support the use of TAXOL at doses of 135 to 175 mg/m2 administered
by a 3-hour intravenous infusion. The same doses administered by 24-hour infusion were more toxic. However, the
study had insufficient power to determine whether a particular dose and schedule produced superior efficacy.
Breast Carcinoma: Data from 83 patients accrued in three phase 2 open label studies and from 471 patients
enrolled in a phase 3 randomized study were available to support the use of TAXOL in patients with metastatic breast
carcinoma.
Phase 2 open label studies: Two studies were conducted in 53 patients previously treated with a maximum of one
prior chemotherapeutic regimen. TAXOL was administered in these 2 trials as a 24-hour infusion at initial doses of
250 mg/m2 (with G-CSF support) or 200 mg/m2 The response rates were 57% (95% Cl: 37% to 75%) and 52%
(95% Cl: 32% to 72%), respectively. The third phase 2 study was conducted in extensively pretreated patients who
had failed anthracycline therapy and who had received a minimum of 2 chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of
metastatic disease. The dose of TAXOL was 200 mg/m2 as a 24-hour infusion with G-CSF support. Nine of 30
patients achieved a partia response, for a response rate of 30% (95% Cl: 15% to 50%).
Phase 3 randomized study: This multicenter trial was conducted in patients previously treated with one or two
6
regimens of chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive TAXOL (paclitaxel) at a dose of either 175 mg/m2 or
135 mg/m2 given as a 3-hour infusion. In the 471 patients enrolled, 60% had symptomatic disease with impaired
performance status at study entry, and 73% had visceral metastases. These patients had failed prior chemotherapy
either in the adjuvant setting (30%), the metastatic setting (39%), or both (31%). Sixty-seven per cent of the patients
had been previously exposed to anthracyclines and 23% of them had disease considered resistant to this class of
agents.
The overall response rate for the 454 evaluable patients was 26% (95% Cl: 22% to 30%), with 17 complete
and 99 partial responses. The median duration of response, measured from the first day of treatment, was 8.1
months (range: 3.4-18.1 + months). Overall for the 471 patients, the median time to progression was 3.5 months
(range 0.03-17.1 months). Median survival was 11.7 months (range: 0-18.9 months)
Response rates, median survival and median time to progression for the 2 arms are given in the following

The adverse event profile of the patients who received single-agent Taxol in this Phase 3 study was
generally consistent with that seen for the pooled analysis performed on data from 812 patients treated in 10 clinical
studies. These adverse events and adverse events for the phase 3 breast carcinoma study are described in the
ADVERSE REACTIONS section of the label, in tabular (Table 8 & 11) and narrative form.
Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC):
In a Phase 3 open-label randomized study conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), 599
patients were randomized to either TAXOL (T) 135 mg/m2 as a 24-hour infusion in combination with cisplatin (c) 75
7
mg/m2, TAXOL (T) 250 mg/m2 as a 24-hour infusion in combination with cisplatin (c) 75 mg/m2 with G-CSF support, or
cisplatin (c) 75 mg/m2 on day 1 followed by etoposide (VP) 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3 (control)
Response rates, median time to progression, median survival, and one-year survival rates are given in the

C Statistical significance is questionable due to multiple comparisons.
Response rate in each of the TAXOL/cisplatin arms was significantly higher than in the control
arm: TAXOL 135 mg/m/24 hours plus cisplatin 25% VS. cisplatin/etoposide 12% (p=0.001) and TAXOL
250 mg/m2/24 hours plus cisplatin and G-CSF 23% VS. cisplatin/etoposide 12% (p<0.001). There was a
trend towards longer time to progression for the TAXOL 135 mg/m2/24 hours plus cisplatin arm (median
4.3 months) VS. cisplatin/etoposide arm (median 2.7 months) (p=0.05), and a significantly longer time to
progression for the TAXOL 250 mg/m /24 hour plus cisplatin and G-CSF arm (median 4.9 months) VS.
cisplatin/etoposide arm (median 2.7 months) (p=0.004).
The median surviva times in the TAXOL 135 mg/m?/24 hours plus cisplatin arm (median 9.3
months) and in the TAXOL 250 mg/m2/24 hours plus cisplatin and G-CSF arm (median 10.0 months)
were numerically superior to the median survival time in the cisplatin/etoposide arm (median 7.4
months) However these differences were not statistically significant (p=0.12 and p=0.08, respectively.)
In the ECOG study, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) questionnaire
had 7 subscales which measured subjective assessment of treatment. Of the seven, the Lung Cancer
Specific Symptoms subscale showed a lesser rate of deterioration for the treatment arm of Taxol 135
mg/m/24 hours plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin/etoposide arm.
The adverse event profile for patients who received TAXOL in combination with cisplatin in this
8
study was generally consistent with that seen for the pooled analysis performed on data from 812
patients treated with single-agent TAXOL in 10 clinical studies These adverse events and adverse events
from the phase 3 first-line NSCLC study are described in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of the label in tabular
(Table 8 & 12) and narrative form.
AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma: Data from two Phase 2 open label studies support the use of TAXOL as second-
line therapy in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Fifty-nine of the 85 patients enrolled in these studies had
previously received systemic therapy, including interferon alpha (32%), DaunoXome (31%), DOXIL (2%), and
doxorubicin containing chemotherapy (42%), with 64% having received prior anthracyclines. Eighty-five percent of
the pretreated patients had progressed on, or could not tolerate, prior systemic therapy.
In Study CA139-174 patients received TAXOL at 135 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion every 3 weeks (intended
dose intensity 45 mg/m2/week). If no dose-limiting toxicity was observed, patients were to receive 155 mg/m2 and 175
mg/m2 in subsequent courses. Hematopoietic growth factors were not to be used initially. In Study CA139-281
patients received TAXOL at 100 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion every 2 weeks (intended dose intensity 50 mg/m2/week)
In this study patients could be receiving hematopoietic growth factors before the start of TAXOL therapy, or this
support was to be initiated as indicated; the dose of TAXOL was not increased. The dose intensity of TAXOL used in
this patient population was lower than the dose intensity recommended for other solid tumors.
All patients had widespread and poor risk disease. Applying the ACTG staging criteria to patients with prior
systemic therapy, 93% were poor risk for extent of disease (T1), 88% had a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 (l1), and 97%
had poor risk considering their systemic illness (S1)
All patients in Study CA139-174 had a Karnofsky performance status of 80 or 90 at baseline; in Study
CA139-281, there were 26 (46%) patients with a Karnofsky performance status of 70 or worse at baseline.

Although the planned dose intensity in the two studies was slightly different (45 mg/m2/week in Study CA139-
174 and 50 mg/m2/week in Study CA139-281), delivered dose intensity was 38-39 mg/m2/week in both studies, with a
similar range (20-24 to 51-61).

Efficacy: The efficacy of TAXOL was evaluated by assessing cutaneous tumor response according to the amended
ACTG criteria and by seeking evidence of clinical benefit in patients in six domains of symptoms and/or conditions
that are commonly related to AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.
Cutaneous Tumor Response (Amended ACTG Criteria): The objective response rate was 59% (95% Cl: 46% to
72%) (35 of 59 patients) in patients with prior systemic therapy. Cutaneous responses were primarily defined as
flattening of more than 50% of previously raised lesions.

The median time to response was 8.1 weeks and the median duration of response measured from the first
day of treatment was 10.4 months (95% Cl: 7.0 to 11.0 months) for the patients who had previously received systemic
therapy. The median time to progression was 6.2 months (95% Cl: 4.6 to 8.7 months).
Additional Clinical Benefit: Most data on patient benefit were assessed retrospectively (plans for such analyses were
not included in the study protocols). Nonetheless, clinical descriptions and photographs indicated clear benefit in
some patients, including instances of improved pulmonary function in patients with pulmonary involvement, improved
ambulation, resolution of ulcers, and decreased analgesic requirements in patients with KS involving the feet and
resolution of facial lesions and edema in patients with KS involving the face, extremities, and genitalia.
Safety: The adverse event profile of TAXOL administered to patients with advanced HIV disease and poor-risk AIDS-
related Kaposi's sarcoma was generally consistent with that seen in the pooled analysis of data from 812 patients
with solid tumors. These adverse events and adverse events from the phase 2 second-line Kaposi's sarcoma studies
are described in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of the label, in tabular (Table 8 & 13) and narrative form. In this
immunosuppressed patient population, however, a lower dose intensity of TAXOL and supportive therapy including
hematopoietic growth factors in patients with severe neutropenia are recommended. Patients with AIDS-related
Kaposi' sarcoma may have more severe hematologic toxicities than patients with solid tumors.
