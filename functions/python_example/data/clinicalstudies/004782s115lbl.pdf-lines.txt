Effects on Vasomotor Symptoms
In the first year of the Health and Osteoporosis, Progestin and Estrogen (HOPE) Study, a total of 2805
postmenopausal women (average age 53.3 + 4.9 years) were randomly assigned to one of eight
treatment groups, receiving either placebo or conjugated estrogens with or without
medroxyprogesterone acetate.
Efficacy for vasomotor symptoms was assessed during the first 12 weeks of treatment in a subset of
symptomatic women (n 241) who had at least 7 moderate to severe hot flushes daily or at least 50
moderate to severe hot flushes during the week before randomization. Premarin (0.3 mg, 0.45 mg, and
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 7
0.625 mg tablets) was shown to be statistically better than placebo at weeks 4 and 12 for relief of both
the frequency and severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms. Table 2 shows the adjusted
mean number of hot flushes in the Premarin 0.3 mg, 0.45 mg, and 0.625 mg and placebo treatment
groups over the initial 12-week period.

1.2.9 Effects on Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy
Results of vaginal maturation indexes at cycles 6 and 13 showed that the differences from placebo
were statistically significant (p<0.001) for all treatment groups (conjugated estrogens alone and
conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment groups).
Effects on Bone Mineral Density.
IN THE 3-YEAR RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED POSTMENOPAUSAL
ESTROGEN/PROGESTIN INTERVENTIONS (PEPI) TRIAL, THE EFFECT OF PREMARIN 0.625 MG
(CONJUGATED ESTROGENS TABLETS, USP), GIVEN ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH
MEDROXYPROGESTERONE ACETATE (MPA), ON BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD) WAS EVALUATED IN
POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. ONE OF THE REGIMENS EVALUATED WAS CONTINUOUS COMBINED
PREMARIN 0.625 MG/MPA 2.5 MG, A REGIMEN SIMILAR TO PREMPRO.
Intent-to-treat subjects
In the intent-to-treat subjects, BMD increased significantly (p<0.001) compared to baseline or placebo
at both the hip and the spine in women assigned to Premarin or the continuous Premarin/MPA
regimen. Spinal BMD increased 3.46% among women assigned to Premarin, increased 4.87% in
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 8
women assigned to the Premarin/MPA regimen and decreased 1.81% in women assigned to placebo.
At the hip, women assigned to Premarin gained 1.31%, women assigned to Premarin/MPA gained
1.94%, while women assigned to placebo lost 1.62%.
Adherent subjects
IN THE ADHERENT SUBJECTS, BMD ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.001) COMPARED TO
BASELINE OR PLACEBO AT BOTH THE HIP AND THE SPINE IN WOMEN ASSIGNED TO PREMARIN OR
CONTINUOUS PREMARIN/MPA. SPINAL BMD INCREASED 5.16% AMONG WOMEN ASSIGNED TO
PREMARIN, INCREASED 5.49% IN WOMEN ASSIGNED TO PREMARIN/MPA AND DECREASED 2.82% IN
WOMEN ASSIGNED TO PLACEBO. AT THE HIP, WOMEN ASSIGNED TO PREMARIN GAINED 2.60%, WOMEN
ASSIGNED TO PREMARIN/MPA GAINED 2.23% WHILE WOMEN ASSIGNED TO PLACEBO LOST 2.17%.
These results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 below.

Women's Health Initiative Studies.
The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled a total of 27,000 predominantly healthy
postmenopausal women to assess the risks and benefits of either the use of Premarin (0.625 mg
conjugated equine estrogens per day) alone or the use of Prempro (0.625 mg conjugated equine
estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate per day) compared to placebo in the prevention of
certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD)
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 10
(nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse
outcome studied. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer,
stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to
other cause. The study did not evaluate the effects of Premarin or Prempro on menopausal symptoms.
The Premarin-only substudy is continuing and results have not been reported. The Prempro substudy
was stopped early because, according to the predefined stopping rule, the increased risk of breast
cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index."
Results of the Prempro substudy, which included 16,608 women (average age of 63 years, range 50 to
79; 83.9% White, 6.5% Black, 5.5% Hispanic), after an average follow-up of 5.2 years are presented in

b: Includes metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancer with the exception of in situ breast cancer
c: A subset of the events was combined in a "global index", defined as the earliest occurrence of CHD events,
invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death
due to other causes
d: Not included in Global Index
Nominal confidence intervals unadjusted for multiple looks and multiple comparisons
For those outcomes included in the "global index," absolute excess risks per 10,000 person-years in the
group treated with Prempro were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more
invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10,000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal
cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the "global index"
was 19 per 10,000 person-years. There was no difference between the groups in terms of all-cause
mortality. (See BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS.)
