ESTROGENS INCREASE THE RISK OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
Close clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogens is important. Adequate diagnostic measures,
including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all
cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the
use of "natural" estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of
equivalent estrogen dose.
CARDIOVASCULAR AND OTHER RISKS
Estrogens with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study reported increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke,
invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women during
5 years of treatment with conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg) combined with
medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg) relative to placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,
Clinical Studies). Other doses of conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate, and other
combinations of estrogens and progestins were not studied in the WHI and, in the absence of
comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar. Because of these risks, estrogens with or
without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration
consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female
reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a
dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human
estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.
The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes
70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause,
most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal
cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate,
are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.
Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two
estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.
CIRCULATING ESTROGENS MODULATE THE PITUITARY SECRETION OF THE GONADOTROPINS,
LUTEINIZING HORMONE (LH) AND FOLLICLE STIMULATING HORMONE (FSH) THROUGH A NEGATIVE
FEEDBACK MECHANISM. ESTROGENS ACT TO REDUCE THE ELEVATED LEVELS OF THESE
GONADOTROPINS SEEN IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN.

Distribution
The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are
widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentration in the sex hormone
target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)
and albumin.
Metabolism
EXOGENOUS ESTROGENS ARE METABOLIZED IN THE SAME MANNER AS ENDOGENOUS ESTROGENS.
CIRCULATING ESTROGENS EXIST IN A DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM OF METABOLIC INTERCONVERSIONS. THESE
TRANSFORMATIONS TAKE PLACE MAINLY IN THE LIVER. ESTRADIOL IS CONVERTED REVERSIBLY TO ESTRONE,
AND BOTH CAN BE CONVERTED TO ESTRIOL, WHICH IS THE MAJOR URINARY METABOLITE. ESTROGENS ALSO
UNDERGO ENTEROHEPATIC RECIRCULATION VIA SULFATE AND GLUCURONIDE CONJUGATION IN THE LIVER,
BILIARY SECRETION OF CONJUGATES INTO THE INTESTINE, AND HYDROLYSIS IN THE GUT FOLLOWED BY
REABSORPTION. IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THE CIRCULATING ESTROGENS
EXISTS AS SULFATE CONJUGATES, ESPECIALLY ESTRONE SULFATE, WHICH SERVES AS A CIRCULATING
RESERVOIR FOR THE FORMATION OF MORE ACTIVE ESTROGENS.
Excretion
ESTRADIOL, ESTRONE, AND ESTRIOL ARE EXCRETED IN THE URINE ALONG WITH GLUCURONIDE AND
SULFATE CONJUGATES.
1.2.6 Special Populations
No PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS, INCLUDING PATIENTS WITH
RENAL OR HEPATIC IMPAIRMENT.
1.2.7 Drug Interactions
Data from a single-dose drug-drug interaction study involving conjugated estrogens and
medroxyprogesterone acetate indicate that the pharmacokinetic dispositions of both drugs are not
significantly altered. No other clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with
conjugated estrogens.
In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450
3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism.
Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John's Wort preparations (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital,
carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a
decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4
such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may
increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects.
1.2.8 Clinical Studies
Effects on Vasomotor Symptoms
In the first year of the Health and Osteoporosis, Progestin and Estrogen (HOPE) Study, a total of 2805
postmenopausal women (average age 53.3 + 4.9 years) were randomly assigned to one of eight
treatment groups, receiving either placebo or conjugated estrogens with or without
medroxyprogesterone acetate.
Efficacy for vasomotor symptoms was assessed during the first 12 weeks of treatment in a subset of
symptomatic women (n 241) who had at least 7 moderate to severe hot flushes daily or at least 50
moderate to severe hot flushes during the week before randomization. Premarin (0.3 mg, 0.45 mg, and
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 7
0.625 mg tablets) was shown to be statistically better than placebo at weeks 4 and 12 for relief of both
the frequency and severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms. Table 2 shows the adjusted
mean number of hot flushes in the Premarin 0.3 mg, 0.45 mg, and 0.625 mg and placebo treatment
groups over the initial 12-week period.

were statistically significant (p<0.001) for all treatment groups (conjugated estrogens alone and
conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment groups).
Effects on Bone Mineral Density.
IN THE 3-YEAR RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED POSTMENOPAUSAL
ESTROGEN/PROGESTIN INTERVENTIONS (PEPI) TRIAL, THE EFFECT OF PREMARIN 0.625 MG
(CONJUGATED ESTROGENS TABLETS, USP), GIVEN ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH

POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. ONE OF THE REGIMENS EVALUATED WAS CONTINUOUS COMBINED
PREMARIN 0.625 MG/MPA 2.5 MG, A REGIMEN SIMILAR TO PREMPRO.
Intent-to-treat subjects
In the intent-to-treat subjects, BMD increased significantly (p<0.001) compared to baseline or placebo
at both the hip and the spine in women assigned to Premarin or the continuous Premarin/MPA
regimen. Spinal BMD increased 3.46% among women assigned to Premarin, increased 4.87% in
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 8
women assigned to the Premarin/MPA regimen and decreased 1.81% in women assigned to placebo.
At the hip, women assigned to Premarin gained 1.31%, women assigned to Premarin/MPA gained
1.94%, while women assigned to placebo lost 1.62%.
Adherent subjects
IN THE ADHERENT SUBJECTS, BMD ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.001) COMPARED TO
BASELINE OR PLACEBO AT BOTH THE HIP AND THE SPINE IN WOMEN ASSIGNED TO PREMARIN OR
CONTINUOUS PREMARIN/MPA. SPINAL BMD INCREASED 5.16% AMONG WOMEN ASSIGNED TO
PREMARIN, INCREASED 5.49% IN WOMEN ASSIGNED TO PREMARIN/MPA AND DECREASED 2.82% IN
WOMEN ASSIGNED TO PLACEBO. AT THE HIP, WOMEN ASSIGNED TO PREMARIN GAINED 2.60%, WOMEN
ASSIGNED TO PREMARIN/MPA GAINED 2.23% WHILE WOMEN ASSIGNED TO PLACEBO LOST 2.17%.
These results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 below.

Women's Health Initiative Studies.
The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled a total of 27,000 predominantly healthy
postmenopausal women to assess the risks and benefits of either the use of Premarin (0.625 mg
conjugated equine estrogens per day) alone or the use of Prempro (0.625 mg conjugated equine
estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate per day) compared to placebo in the prevention of
certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD)
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 10
(nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse
outcome studied. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer,
stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to
other cause. The study did not evaluate the effects of Premarin or Prempro on menopausal symptoms.
The Premarin-only substudy is continuing and results have not been reported. The Prempro substudy
was stopped early because, according to the predefined stopping rule, the increased risk of breast
cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index."
Results of the Prempro substudy, which included 16,608 women (average age of 63 years, range 50 to
79; 83.9% White, 6.5% Black, 5.5% Hispanic), after an average follow-up of 5.2 years are presented in

c: A subset of the events was combined in a "global index", defined as the earliest occurrence of CHD events,
invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death
due to other causes
d: Not included in Global Index
Nominal confidence intervals unadjusted for multiple looks and multiple comparisons
For those outcomes included in the "global index," absolute excess risks per 10,000 person-years in the
group treated with Prempro were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more
invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10,000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal
cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the "global index"
was 19 per 10,000 person-years. There was no difference between the groups in terms of all-cause
mortality. (See BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS.)

INDICATIONS AND USAGE
Premarin therapy is indicated in the:
1. Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause.
2. Treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the
menopause. When prescribing solely for the treatment of symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy,
topical vaginal products should be considered.
3. Treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration or primary ovarian failure.
4. Treatment of breast cancer (for palliation only) in appropriately selected women and men with
metastatic disease.
5. Treatment of advanced androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate (for palliation only).
6. Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. When prescribing solely for the prevention of
postmenopausal osteoporosis, therapy should only be considered for women at significant risk of
osteoporosis and non-estrogen medications should be carefully considered.
THE MAINSTAYS FOR DECREASING THE RISK OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS ARE WEIGHT-
BEARING EXERCISE, ADEQUATE CALCIUM AND VITAMIN D INTAKE, AND WHEN INDICATED
PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY. POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN REQUIRE AN AVERAGE OF 1500 MG/DAY OF
ELEMENTAL CALCIUM. THEREFORE, WHEN NOT CONTRAINDICATED, CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTATION
MAY BE HELPFUL FOR WOMEN WITH SUBOPTIMAL DIETARY INTAKE. VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION
OF 400-800 IU/DAY MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO ENSURE ADEQUATE DAILY INTAKE IN
POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Estrogens should not be used in individuals with any of the following conditions:
1. Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding.
2. Known, suspected, or history of cancer of the breast except in appropriately selected patients being
treated for metastatic disease.
3. Known or suspected estrogen-dependen neoplasia.
4. Active deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or a history of these conditions.
5. Active or recent (e.g., within past year) arterial thromboembolic disease (e.g., stroke, myocardial
infarction).
6. Liver dysfunction or disease.
7. Premarin tablets should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to their ingredients.
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 12
8. Known or suspected pregnancy. There is no indication for Premarin in pregnancy. There appears to
be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used estrogen and progestins from
oral contraceptives inadvertently during pregnancy. (See PRECAUTIONS.)
WARNINGS
EEBOXED WARNINGS.
The use of unopposed estrogens in women who have a uterus is associated with an increased risk of
endometrial cancer.
1.
Cardiovascular Disorders. Estrogen and estrogen/progestin therapy have been associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as venous
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (venous thromboembolism or VTE). Should any of these
occur or be suspected, estrogens should be discontinued immediately.
Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use,
hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (e.g., personal history or
family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed
appropriately.
a.
Coronary heart disease and stroke. In the Premarin substudy of the Women's Health Initiative
study (WHI), an increase in the number of myocardial infarctions and strokes has been observed in
women receiving Premarin compared to placebo. These observations are preliminary, and the study
is continuing. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies.)
In the Prempro substudy of WHI, an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events
(defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction and CHD death) was observed in women receiving
Prempro compared to women receiving placebo (37 VS 30 per 10,000 person-years). The increase
in risk was observed in year one and persisted.
In the same substudy of WHI, an increased risk of stroke was observed in women receiving
Prempro compared to women receiving placebo (29 VS 21 per 10,000 person-years). The increase
in risk was observed after the first year and persisted.
In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n 2,763, average age 66.7 years) a
controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and
Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study; HERS) treatment with Prempro (0.625 mg conjugated
equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate per day) demonstrated no cardiovascular
benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with Prempro did not reduce the
overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease.
There were more CHD events in the Prempro-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but
not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred and twenty one women from the
original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average
follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD
events were comparable among women in the Prempro group and the placebo group in HERS,
HERS II, and overall.
Large doses of estrogen (5 mg conjugated estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat
cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men to
increase the risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis.
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 13
b. Venous thromboembolism (VTE). In the Premarin substudy of the Women's Health Initiative
(WHI), an increase in VTE has been observed in women receiving Premarin compared to placebo.
These observations are preliminary, and the study is continuing. (See CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies.)
In the Prempro substudy of WHI, a 2-fold greater rate of VTE, including deep venous thrombosis
and pulmonary embolism, was observed in women receiving Prempro compared to women
receiving placebo. The rate of VTE was 34 per 10,000 woman-years in the Prempro group
compared to 16 per 10,000 woman-years in the placebo group. The increase in VTE risk was
observed during the first year and persisted.
IF FEASIBLE, ESTROGENS SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AT LEAST 4 TO 6 WEEKS BEFORE SURGERY OF THE
TYPE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF THROMBOEMBOLISM, OR DURING PERIODS OF PROLONGED
IMMOBILIZATION.
2. Malignant neoplasms.
a.
Endometrial cancer. The use of unopposed estrogens in women with intact uteri has been
associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The reported endometrial cancer risk
among unopposed estrogen users with an intact uterus is about 2- to 12-fold greater than in
non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies
show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than one year.
The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold
for five to ten years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years
after estrogen therapy is discontinued.
Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogen/progestin combinations is important. Adequate
diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule
out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.
There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile
than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to postmenopausal
estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a
precursor to endometrial cancer.
b. Breast cancer. Estrogen and estrogen/progestin therapy in postmenopausal women has been
associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. In the Prempro substudy of the Women's
Health Initiative study (WHI), a 26% increase of invasive breast cancer (38 VS 30 per 10,000
woman-years) after an average of 5.2 years of treatment was observed in women receiving
Prempro compared to women receiving placebo. The increased risk of breast cancer became
apparent after 4 years on Prempro. The women reporting prior postmenopausal use of estrogen
and/or estrogen with progestin had a higher relative risk for breast cancer associated with
Prempro than those who had never used these hormones. (See CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies.)
In the Premarin substudy of the WHI study, no increased risk of breast cancer in estrogen-treated
women compared to placebo was reported after an average of 5.2 years of therapy. These data are
preliminary and that substudy of WHI is continuing.
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 14
Epidemiologic studies have reported an increased risk of breast cancer in association with
increasing duration of postmenopausal treatment with estrogens, with or without progestin. This
association was reanalyzed in original data from 51 studies that involved treatment with various
doses and types of estrogens, with and without progestin. In the reanalysis, an increased risk of
having breast cancer diagnosed became apparent after about 5 years of continued treatment, and
subsided after treatment had been discontinued for about 5 years. Some later studies have
suggested that treatment with estrogen and progestin increases the risk of breast cancer more than
treatment with estrogen alone.
A postmenopausal woman without a uterus who requires estrogen should receive estrogen-alone
therapy and should not be exposed unnecessarily to progestins. All postmenopausal women should
receive yearly breast exams by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-
examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age
and risk factors.
3. Gallbladder Disease. A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery
in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.
4.
Hypercalcemia. Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with
breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and
appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.
5. Visual abnormalities. Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving
estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss
of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema
or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be discontinued.
PRECAUTIONS
A. General
1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy.
Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or
daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial
hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a
precursor to endometrial cancer.
There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens
compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include: a possible increased risk of breast cancer,
adverse effects on lipoprotein metabolism (e.g., lowering HDL, raising LDL) and impairment of
glucose tolerance.
2. Elevated blood pressure.
In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to
idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a
generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be
monitored at regular intervals during estrogen use.
3. Hypertriglyceridemia.
In patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with
elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications In the HOPE
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 15
study, the mean percent increase from baseline in serum triglycerides after one year of treatment
with Premarin 0.625 mg, 0.45 mg, and 0.3 mg compared with placebo were 34.3, 30.2, 25.1, and
10.7, respectively. After two years of treatment, the mean percent changes were 47.6, 32.5, 19.0,
and 5.5, respectively.
4. Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundice.
Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a
history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should
be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.
5. Hypothyroidism.
Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Patients with
normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone,
thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on
thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased
doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These patients should have their thyroid function
monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.
6. Fluid retention.
Because estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be
influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when
estrogens are prescribed.
7. Hypocalcemia.
Estrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia.
8. Ovarian cancer.
Use of estrogen-only products, in particular for ten or more years, has been associated with an
increased risk of ovarian cancer in some epidemiological studies. Other studies did not show a
significant association. Data are insufficient to determine whether there is an increased risk with
combined estrogen/progestin therapy in postmenopausal women.
9.
EXACERBATION OF ENDOMETRIOSIS.
ENDOMETRIOSIS MAY BE EXACERBATED WITH ADMINISTRATION OF ESTROGENS.
A FEW CASES OF MALIGNANT TRANSFORMATION OF RESIDUAL ENDOMETRIAL IMPLANTS HAVE
BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN TREATED POST-HYSTERECTOMY WITH ESTROGEN-ONLY THERAPY.
FOR PATIENTS KNOWN TO HAVE RESIDUAL ENDOMETRIOSIS POST-HYSTERECTOMY, THE ADDITION
OF PROGESTIN SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.
10. Exacerbation of other conditions.
Estrogens therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, or
porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with
caution in patients with these conditions.
B. Patient Information.
Physicians are advised to discuss the contents of the PATIENT INFORMATION leaflet with patients
for whom they prescribe Premarin.
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 16
C. Laboratory Tests
Estrogen administration should be initiated at the lowest dose for the treatment of postmenopausal
moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of postmenopausal vulvar
and vaginal atrophy and then guided by clinical response rather than by serum hormone levels (e.g.,
estradiol, FSH). Laboratory parameters may be useful in guiding dosage for the treatment of
hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration and primary ovarian failure.
D. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions.
1. ACCELERATED PROTHROMBIN TIME, PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIME, AND PLATELET
AGGREGATION TIME; INCREASED PLATELET COUNT; INCREASED FACTORS II, VII ANTIGEN, VIII
ANTIGEN, VIII COAGULANT ACTIVITY, IX, X, XII, VII-X COMPLEX, II-VII-X COMPLEX, AND BETA-
THROMBOGLOBULIN; DECREASED LEVELS OF ANTI-FACTOR XA AND ANTITHROMBIN III,
DECREASED ANTITHROMBIN III ACTIVITY; INCREASED LEVELS OF FIBRINOGEN AND FIBRINOGEN
ACTIVITY; INCREASED PLASMINOGEN ANTIGEN AND ACTIVITY.
2.
Increased thyroid binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid
hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by
radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the
elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Patients on thyroid replacement
therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone.
3. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, i.e., corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex
hormone binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased circulating corticosteroids and sex
steroids, respectively. Free or biologically active hormone concentrations are unchanged. Other
plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/ renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin,
ceruloplasmin).
4. Increased plasma HDL and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced LDL cholesterol
concentrations, increased triglyceride levels.
5. Impaired glucose tolerance.
6. Reduced response to metyrapone test.
E. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility.
Long term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species
increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver. (See
BOXED WARNINGS, CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).
F. Pregnancy.
Premarin should not be used during pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).
G. Nursing Mothers.
Estrogen administration to nursing mothers has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the
milk. Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving this drug.
Caution should be exercised when Premarin is administered to a nursing woman.
H. Pediatric Use.
ESTROGEN THERAPY HAS BEEN USED FOR THE INDUCTION OF PUBERTY IN ADOLESCENTS WITH SOME
FORMS OF PUBERTAL DELAY. SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS HAVE NOT
OTHERWISE BEEN ESTABLISHED.
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 17
LARGE AND REPEATED DOSES OF ESTROGEN OVER AN EXTENDED TIME PERIOD HAVE BEEN SHOWN
TO ACCELERATE EPIPHYSEAL CLOSURE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SHORT STATURE IF TREATMENT IS
INITIATED BEFORE THE COMPLETION OF PHYSIOLOGIC PUBERTY IN NORMALLY DEVELOPING
CHILDREN. IF ESTROGEN IS ADMINISTERED TO PATIENTS WHOSE BONE GROWTH IS NOT COMPLETE
PERIODIC MONITORING OF BONE MATURATION AND EFFECTS ON EPIPHYSEAL CENTERS IS
RECOMMENDED DURING ESTROGEN ADMINISTRATION.
ESTROGEN TREATMENT OF PREPUBERTAL GIRLS ALSO INDUCES PREMATURE BREAST DEVELOPMENT
AND VAGINAL CORNIFICATION, AND MAY INDUCE VAGINAL BLEEDING. IN BOYS, ESTROGEN
TREATMENT MAY MODIFY THE NORMAL PUBERTAL PROCESS AND INDUCE GYNECOMASTIA. SEE
INDICATIONS AND DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION SECTIONS.
I. Geriatric Use.
Of the total number of subjects in the Prempro substudy of the Women's Health Initiative study, 44%
(n=7320) were 65 years and over, while 6.6% (n=1,095) were 75 and over (see CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies). No significant differences in safety were observed between
subjects 65 years and over compared to younger subjects. There was a higher incidence of stroke and
invasive breast cancer in women 75 and over compared to younger subjects.
WITH RESPECT TO EFFICACY IN THE APPROVED INDICATIONS, THERE HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT
NUMBERS OF GERIATRIC PATIENTS INVOLVED IN STUDIES UTILIZING PREMARIN TO DETERMINE
WHETHER THOSE OVER 65 YEARS OF AGE DIFFER FROM YOUNGER SUBJECTS IN THEIR RESPONSE TO
PREMARIN.
1.2.10 ADVERSE REACTIONS
See BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS.
BECAUSE CLINICAL TRIALS ARE CONDUCTED UNDER WIDELY VARYING CONDITIONS, ADVERSE
REACTION RATES OBSERVED IN THE CLINICAL TRIALS OF A DRUG CANNOT BE DIRECTLY COMPARED
TO RATES IN THE CLINICAL TRIALS OF ANOTHER DRUG AND MAY NOT REFLECT THE RATES OBSERVED
IN PRACTICE. THE ADVERSE REACTION INFORMATION FROM CLINICAL TRIALS DOES, HOWEVER,
PROVIDE A BASIS FOR IDENTIFYING THE ADVERSE EVENTS THAT APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO DRUG
USE AND FOR APPROXIMATING RATES.
During the first year of a 2-year clinical trial with 2333 postmenopausal women between 40 and 65
years of age (88% Caucasian), 1012 women were treated with conjugated estrogens and 332 were
treated with placebo. Table 8 summarizes adverse events that occurred at a rate of > 5%.

NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 21
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, progestin should also be
initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin.
Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be limited to the shortest duration
consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated
periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., at 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is
still necessary (see BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS). For women with a uterus, adequate
diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out
malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.
1.
For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and/or moderate to severe symptoms of
vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause. When prescribing solely for the
treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, topical vaginal products
should be considered.
PATIENTS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH THE LOWEST EFFECTIVE DOSE. GENERALLY WOMEN
SHOULD BE STARTED AT 0.3 MG PREMARIN DAILY.SUBSEQUENT DOSAGE ADJUSTMENT MAY BE
MADE BASED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT RESPONSE THIS DOSE SHOULD BE PERIODICALLY
REASSESSED BY THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER.
Premarin therapy may be given continuously with no interruption in therapy, or in cyclical
regimens (regimens such as 25 days on drug followed by five days off drug) as is medically
appropriate on an individualized basis.
2.
FOR PREVENTION OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS:
When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, therapy should be considered only for women
at significant risk of osteoporosis and non-estrogen medications should be carefully considered. Patients should be
treated with the lowest effective dose. Generally women should be started at 0.625 mg Premarin daily. Dosage may be
adjusted depending on individual clinical and bone mineral density responses. This dose should be periodically
reassessed by the healthcare provider.
Premarin therapy may be given continuously with no interruption in therapy, or in cyclical
regimens (regimens such as 25 days on drug followed by five days off drug) as is medically
appropriate on an individualized basis.
3. For treatment of female hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian
failure:
Female hypogonadismae 0.3 mg to 0.625 mg daily, administered cyclically (e.g., three weeks on
and one week off). Doses are adjusted depending on the severity of symptoms and responsiveness
of the endometrium.
IN CLINICAL STUDIES OF DELAYED PUBERTY DUE TO FEMALE HYPOGONADISM, BREAST
DEVELOPMENT WAS INDUCED BY DOSES AS LOW AS 0.15 MG. THE DOSAGE MAY BE GRADUALLY
TITRATED UPWARD AT 6 TO 12 MONTH INTERVALS AS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE APPROPRIATE BONE
AGE ADVANCEMENT AND EVENTUAL EPIPHYSEAL CLOSURE. CLINICAL STUDIES SUGGEST THAT
DOSES OF 0.15 MG, 0.3 MG, AND 0.6 MG ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MEAN RATIOS OF BONE AGE
ADVANCEMENT TO CHRONOLOGICAL AGE PROGRESSION (DBA/DCA) OF 1.1, 1.5, AND 2.1,
RESPECTIVELY. (PREMARIN IN THE DOSE STRENGTH OF 0.15 MG IS NOT AVAILABLE
COMMERCIALLY). AVAILABLE DATA SUGGEST THAT CHRONIC DOSING WITH 0.625 MG IS
NDA 04-782/S-115, S-130
Page 22
SUFFICIENT TO INDUCE ARTIFICIAL CYCLIC MENSES WITH SEQUENTIAL PROGESTIN TREATMENT
AND TO MAINTAIN BONE MINERAL DENSITY AFTER SKELETAL MATURITY IS ACHIEVED.
Female castration or primary ovarian failureae 1.25 mg daily, cyclically. Adjust dosage, upward or
downward, according to severity of symptoms and response of the patient. For maintenance, adjust
dosage to lowest level that will provide effective control.
4.
For treatment of breast cancer, for palliation only, in appropriately selected women and men
with metastatic disease:
Suggested dosage is 10 mg three times daily for a period of at least three months.
5. For treatment of advanced androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate, for palliation only:
1.25 mg to 2.5 mg three times daily. The effectiveness of therapy can be judged by phosphatase
determinations as well as by symptomatic improvement of the patient.

1.2.11 PATIENT INFORMATION
Premarin
(conjugated estrogens tablets, USP)
READ THIS PATIENT INFORMATION BEFORE YOU START TAKING PREMARIN AND READ WHAT YOU GET
EACH TIME YOU REFILL PREMARIN. THERE MAY BE NEW INFORMATION. THIS INFORMATION DOES NOT
TAKE THE PLACE OF TALKING TO YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER ABOUT YOUR MEDICAL CONDITION
OR YOUR TREATMENT.
What is the most important information I should know about Premarin (an estrogen
mixture)?
Estrogens increase the chances of getting cancer of the uterus.
Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away while you are taking Premarin. Vaginal
bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus (womb). Your
healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause.
E
Do not use estrogens with or without progestins to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, or
strokes.
Using estrogens with or without progestins may increase your chances of getting heart
attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and blood clots. You and your healthcare provider should
talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with estrogens.
1.2.12 What is Premarin?
PREMARIN IS A MEDICINE THAT CONTAINS A MIXTURE OF ESTROGEN HORMONES.
Premarin is used after menopause to:
reduce moderate to severe hot flashes. Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The
ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 and 55 years old. This drop
in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual
periods). Sometimes both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes
place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause."
When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms,
such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and
sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women the symptoms are mild, and they will not
need to take estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your healthcare
provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Premarin.
E treat moderate to severe dryness, itching, and burning, in and around the vagina.=You and
your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with
Premarin to control these problems.

help reduce your chances of getting osteoporosis (thin weak bones). Osteoporosis from
menopause is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and easier to break. If you use
Premarin only to prevent osteoporosis from menopause, talk with your healthcare provider about
whether a different treatment or medicine without estrogens might be better for you. You and your
healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you should continue with Premarin.
Weight-bearing exercise, like walking or running, and taking calcium and vitamin D supplements
may also lower your chances for getting postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is important to talk about
exercise and supplements with your healthcare provider before starting them.
Premarin is also used to:
Z
treat certain conditions in women before menopause if their ovaries do not make enough
estrogen naturally.
Z ease symptoms of certain cancers that have spread through the body, in men and women.
1.2.13 Who should not take Premarin?
DO NOT START TAKING PREMARIN IF YOU:
E
HAVE UNUSUAL VAGINAL BLEEDING.
Z currently have or have had certain cancers. Estrogens may increase the chances of getting
certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus. If you have or have had cancer,
