INJECTION
WARNING
TAXOLO (paclitaxel) should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of cancer
chemotherapeutic agents. Appropriate management of complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and
treatment facilities are readily available.
Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by dyspnea and hypotension requiring treatment,
angioedema, and generalized urticaria have occurred in 2%-4% of patients receiving TAXOL in clinical trials. Fatal
reactions have occurred in patients despite premedication. All patients should be pretreated with corticosteroids,
diphenhydramine, and H2 antagonists. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.) Patients who experience severe
hypersensitivity reactions to TAXOL should not be rechallenged with the drug.
TAXOL therapy should not be given to patients with solid tumors who have baseline neutrophi counts of less than 1500
cells/mm and should not be given to patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma if the baseline neutrophil count is less
than 1000 cells/mm In order to monitor the occurrence of bone marrow suppression, primarily neutropenia, which may
be severe and result in infection, it is recommended that frequent peripheral blood cell counts be performed on all
patients receiving TAXOL.
DESCRIPTION
TAXOL (paclitaxel) Injection is a clear colorless to slightly yellow viscous solution. It is supplied as a nonaqueous
solution intended for dilution with a suitable parenteral fluid prior to intravenous infusion. TAXOL is available in 30 mg
5 mL), 100 mg (16.7 mL), and 300 mg (50 mL) multidose vials. Each mL of sterile nonpyrogenic solution contains 6
mg
paclitaxel, 527 mg of purified Cremophor EL* (polyoxyethylated castor oil) and 49.7% (v/v) dehydrated alcohol,
USP.
Paclitaxe is a natural product with antitumor activity. TAXOL (paclitaxel) is obtained via a semi-synthetic
process from Taxus baccata. The chemical name for paclitaxel s5p,20-Epoxy-1,2a,47B,10p,13a-hexahydroxytax

Paclitaxel has the following structural formula:
Paclitaxe is a white to off-white crystalline powder with the empirical formula C47H51NO14 and a molecular
weight of 853.9. It is highly lipophilic, insoluble in water, and melts at around 216-217C
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Paclitaxel is a novel antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and
stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic
reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In
addition, paclitaxe induces abnormal arrays or "bundles" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple
asters of microtubules during mitosis.
Following intravenous administration of TAXOL, paclitaxel plasma concentrations decline in a biphasic
manner. The initial rapid decline represents distribution to the peripheral compartment and elimination of the drug.
The later phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of paclitaxel from the peripheral compartment.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of paclitaxel following 3- and 24-hour infusions of TAXOL at dose levels of 135
and 175 mg/m2 were determined in a Phase 3 randomized study in ovarian cancer patients and are summarized in
the following table:

It appeared that with the 24-hour infusion of TAXOL, a 30% increase in dose (135 mg/m2 versus 175 mg/m2)
increased the CMax by 87%, whereas the AUC(0-o) remained proportional However, with a 3-hour infusion, for a
2
30% increase in dose, the CMax and AUC(0-o0) were increased by 68% and 89%, respectively The mean apparent
volume of distribution at steady state, with the 24-hour infusion of TAXOL, ranged from 227 to 688 L/m2, indicating
extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding of paclitaxel.
The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel were also evaluated in adult cancer patients who received single doses
of 15-135 mg/m2 given by 1-hour infusions (n=15), 30-275 mg/m2 given by 6-hour infusions (n=36), and 200-275
mg/m2 given by 24-hour infusions (n=54) in Phase 1 & 2 studies. Values for CLT and volume of distribution were
consistent with the findings in the Phase 3 study. The pharmacokinetics of TAXOL in patients with AIDS-related
Kaposi's sarcoma have not been studied.
In vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50
ug/mL, indicate that between 89-98% of drug is bound; the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or
diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel.
After intravenous administration of 15-275 mg/m2 doses of TAXOL as 1-, 6-, or 24-hour infusions, mean
values for cumulative urinary recovery of unchanged drug ranged from 1.3% to 12.6% of the dose, indicating
extensive non-renal clearance In five patients administered a 225 or 250 mg/m2 dose of radiolabeled TAXOL as a 3-
hour infusion, a mean of 71% of the radioactivity was excreted in the feces in 120 hours, and 14% was recovered in
the urine. Total recovery of radioactivity ranged from 56% to 101% of the dose. Paclitaxel represented a mean of 5%
of the administered radioactivity recovered in the feces, while metabolites, primarily 6a-hydroxypaclitaxel, accounted
for the balance. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices showed that paclitaxe was
metabolized primarily to 6a-hydroxypaclitaxe by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2C8; and to two minor
metabolites, 3'-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6a,3'-p-dihydroxypaclitaxel, by CYP3A4. In vitro, the metabolism of paclitaxel
to
6a-hydroxypaclitaxel was inhibited by a number of agents (ketoconazole, verapamil, diazepam, quinidine,
dexamethasone, cyclosporin, teniposide, etoposide, and vincristine), but the concentrations used exceeded those
found in vivo following normal therapeutic doses. Testosterone, 17c-ethiny estradiol, retinoic acid, and quercetin, a
specific inhibitor of CYP2C8, also inhibited the formation of 6a-hydroxypaclitaxel in vitro. The pharmacokinetics of
paclitaxel may also be altered in vivo as a result of interactions with compounds that are substrates, inducers, or
inhibitors of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions section.) The effect of renal or
hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of paclitaxel has not been investigated.
Possible interactions of paclitaxe with concomitantly administered medications have not been formally
investigated.
CLINICAL STUDIES
Ovarian Carcinoma
First-Line Data: The safety and efficacy of TAXOL (135 mg/m2 over 24 hr) in combination with cisplatin (75 mg/m2) in
3
patients with advanced ovarian cancer and no prior chemotherapy were evaluated in a Phase 3 multicenter,
randomized, controlled (vs cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2) clinica trial conducted by the
Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG). A total of 410 patients with Stage III or IV disease (>1 cm residual disease after
staging laparotomy or distant metastases) were randomized. Patients treated with TAXOL in combination with
cisplatin had significantly longer time to progression (median 16.6 VS. 13.0 months, p=0.0008) and nearly a year
longer median survival time (p=0.0002) compared with standard therapy

The adverse event profile for patients receiving TAXOL in combination with cisplatin in this study was generally
consistent with that seen for the pooled analysis performed on data from 812 patients treated with single-agent
TAXOL in 10 clinical studies. These adverse events and adverse events from the phase 3 first-line ovarian
carcinoma study are described in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of the label, in tabular (Table 8 & 9) and
narrative form.

Second-Line Data: Data from five Phase 1 & 2 clinical studies (189 patients), a multicenter randomized Phase 3 study
(407 patients) as well as an interim analysis of data from more than 300 patients enrolled in a treatment referral
center program were used in support of the use of TAXOL in patients who have failed initia or subsequent
chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoma of the ovary. Two of the Phase 2 studies (92 patients) utilized an initia dose
of 135 to 170 mg/m2 in most patients (>90%) administered over 24 hours by continuous infusion. Response rates in
these two studies were 22% (95% Cl: 11% to 37%) and 30% (95% Cl: 18% to 46%) with a total of six complete and
18 partia responses in 92 patients. The median duration of overall response in these two studies measured from the
first day of treatment was 7.2 months (range: 3.5-15.8 months) and 7.5 months (range: 5.3-17.4 months)
respectively. The median survival was 8.1 months (range: 0.2-36.7 months) and 15.9 months (range: 1.8-34.5 +
months).
The Phase 3 study had a bifactorial design and compared the efficacy and safety of TAXOL, administered at
two different doses (135 or 175 mg/m2) and schedules (3- or 24-hour infusion). The overall response rate for the 407
patients was 16.2% (95% Cl: 12.8% to 20.2%), with 6 complete and 60 partia responses Duration of response,
measured from the first day of treatment was 8.3 months (range: 3.2-21.6 months). Median time to progression was
3.7 months (range 0.1+ - 25.1+ months). Median surviva was 11.5 months (range: 0.2-26.3 + months).
Response rates, median survival and median time to progression for the 4 arms are given in the following
table.

Analyses were performed as planned by the bifactorial study design described in the protocol, by comparing
the two doses (135 or 175 mg/m2) irrespective of the schedule (3 or 24 hours) and the two schedules irrespective of
dose. Patients receiving the 175 mg/m2 dose had a response rate similar to that for those receiving the 135 mg/m2
dose: 18% VS. 14% (p=0.28). No difference in response rate was detected when comparing the 3-hour with the 24-
hour infusion: 15% VS. 17% (p=0.50). Patients receiving the 175 mg/m2 dose of TAXOL had a longer time to
progression than those receiving the 135 mg/m2 dose: median 4.2 VS. 3.1 months (p=0.03). There was no statistically
significant difference in time to progression for patients receiving the 3-hour VS. the 24-hour infusion: 4.0 months VS.
3.7 months (p=0.08). Median survival was 11.6 months in patients receiving the 175 mg/m2 dose of TAXOL and 11.0
months in patients receiving the 135 mg/m2 dose (p=0.92). Median survival was 11.7 months for patients receiving
the 3-hour infusion of TAXOL and 11.2 months for patients receiving the 24-hour infusion (p=0.91). These statistical
analyses should be viewed with caution because of the multiple comparisons made.
TAXOL remained active in patients who had developed resistance to platinum-containing therapy (defined
as tumor progression while on, or tumor relapse within 6 months from completion of, a platinum containing regimen)
with response rates of 14% in the Phase 3 study and 31% in the Phase 1 & 2 clinical studies.
The adverse event profile in this Phase 3 study was generally consistent with that seen for the pooled
analysis performed on data from 812 patients treated in ten clinical studies. These adverse events and adverse
events from the phase 3 second-line ovarian carcinoma study are described in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of
the label, in tabular (Table 8 & 10) and narrative form.
The results of this randomized study support the use of TAXOL at doses of 135 to 175 mg/m2 administered
by a 3-hour intravenous infusion. The same doses administered by 24-hour infusion were more toxic. However, the
study had insufficient power to determine whether a particular dose and schedule produced superior efficacy.
Breast Carcinoma: Data from 83 patients accrued in three phase 2 open label studies and from 471 patients
enrolled in a phase 3 randomized study were available to support the use of TAXOL in patients with metastatic breast
carcinoma.
Phase 2 open label studies: Two studies were conducted in 53 patients previously treated with a maximum of one
prior chemotherapeutic regimen. TAXOL was administered in these 2 trials as a 24-hour infusion at initial doses of
250 mg/m2 (with G-CSF support) or 200 mg/m2 The response rates were 57% (95% Cl: 37% to 75%) and 52%
(95% Cl: 32% to 72%), respectively. The third phase 2 study was conducted in extensively pretreated patients who
had failed anthracycline therapy and who had received a minimum of 2 chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of
metastatic disease. The dose of TAXOL was 200 mg/m2 as a 24-hour infusion with G-CSF support. Nine of 30
patients achieved a partia response, for a response rate of 30% (95% Cl: 15% to 50%).
Phase 3 randomized study: This multicenter trial was conducted in patients previously treated with one or two
6
regimens of chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive TAXOL (paclitaxel) at a dose of either 175 mg/m2 or
135 mg/m2 given as a 3-hour infusion. In the 471 patients enrolled, 60% had symptomatic disease with impaired
performance status at study entry, and 73% had visceral metastases. These patients had failed prior chemotherapy
either in the adjuvant setting (30%), the metastatic setting (39%), or both (31%). Sixty-seven per cent of the patients
had been previously exposed to anthracyclines and 23% of them had disease considered resistant to this class of
agents.
The overall response rate for the 454 evaluable patients was 26% (95% Cl: 22% to 30%), with 17 complete
and 99 partial responses. The median duration of response, measured from the first day of treatment, was 8.1
months (range: 3.4-18.1 + months). Overall for the 471 patients, the median time to progression was 3.5 months
(range 0.03-17.1 months). Median survival was 11.7 months (range: 0-18.9 months)
Response rates, median survival and median time to progression for the 2 arms are given in the following

The adverse event profile of the patients who received single-agent Taxol in this Phase 3 study was
generally consistent with that seen for the pooled analysis performed on data from 812 patients treated in 10 clinical
studies. These adverse events and adverse events for the phase 3 breast carcinoma study are described in the
ADVERSE REACTIONS section of the label, in tabular (Table 8 & 11) and narrative form.
Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC):
In a Phase 3 open-label randomized study conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), 599
patients were randomized to either TAXOL (T) 135 mg/m2 as a 24-hour infusion in combination with cisplatin (c) 75
7
mg/m2, TAXOL (T) 250 mg/m2 as a 24-hour infusion in combination with cisplatin (c) 75 mg/m2 with G-CSF support, or

C Statistical significance is questionable due to multiple comparisons.
Response rate in each of the TAXOL/cisplatin arms was significantly higher than in the control
arm: TAXOL 135 mg/m/24 hours plus cisplatin 25% VS. cisplatin/etoposide 12% (p=0.001) and TAXOL
250 mg/m2/24 hours plus cisplatin and G-CSF 23% VS. cisplatin/etoposide 12% (p<0.001). There was a
trend towards longer time to progression for the TAXOL 135 mg/m2/24 hours plus cisplatin arm (median
4.3 months) VS. cisplatin/etoposide arm (median 2.7 months) (p=0.05), and a significantly longer time to
progression for the TAXOL 250 mg/m /24 hour plus cisplatin and G-CSF arm (median 4.9 months) VS.
cisplatin/etoposide arm (median 2.7 months) (p=0.004).
The median surviva times in the TAXOL 135 mg/m?/24 hours plus cisplatin arm (median 9.3
months) and in the TAXOL 250 mg/m2/24 hours plus cisplatin and G-CSF arm (median 10.0 months)
were numerically superior to the median survival time in the cisplatin/etoposide arm (median 7.4
months) However these differences were not statistically significant (p=0.12 and p=0.08, respectively.)
In the ECOG study, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) questionnaire
had 7 subscales which measured subjective assessment of treatment. Of the seven, the Lung Cancer
Specific Symptoms subscale showed a lesser rate of deterioration for the treatment arm of Taxol 135
mg/m/24 hours plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin/etoposide arm.
The adverse event profile for patients who received TAXOL in combination with cisplatin in this
8
study was generally consistent with that seen for the pooled analysis performed on data from 812
patients treated with single-agent TAXOL in 10 clinical studies These adverse events and adverse events
from the phase 3 first-line NSCLC study are described in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of the label in tabular
(Table 8 & 12) and narrative form.
AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma: Data from two Phase 2 open label studies support the use of TAXOL as second-
line therapy in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Fifty-nine of the 85 patients enrolled in these studies had
previously received systemic therapy, including interferon alpha (32%), DaunoXome (31%), DOXIL (2%), and
doxorubicin containing chemotherapy (42%), with 64% having received prior anthracyclines. Eighty-five percent of
the pretreated patients had progressed on, or could not tolerate, prior systemic therapy.
In Study CA139-174 patients received TAXOL at 135 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion every 3 weeks (intended
dose intensity 45 mg/m2/week). If no dose-limiting toxicity was observed, patients were to receive 155 mg/m2 and 175
mg/m2 in subsequent courses. Hematopoietic growth factors were not to be used initially. In Study CA139-281
patients received TAXOL at 100 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion every 2 weeks (intended dose intensity 50 mg/m2/week)
In this study patients could be receiving hematopoietic growth factors before the start of TAXOL therapy, or this
support was to be initiated as indicated; the dose of TAXOL was not increased. The dose intensity of TAXOL used in
this patient population was lower than the dose intensity recommended for other solid tumors.
All patients had widespread and poor risk disease. Applying the ACTG staging criteria to patients with prior
systemic therapy, 93% were poor risk for extent of disease (T1), 88% had a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 (l1), and 97%
had poor risk considering their systemic illness (S1)
All patients in Study CA139-174 had a Karnofsky performance status of 80 or 90 at baseline; in Study
CA139-281, there were 26 (46%) patients with a Karnofsky performance status of 70 or worse at baseline.

Although the planned dose intensity in the two studies was slightly different (45 mg/m2/week in Study CA139-
174 and 50 mg/m2/week in Study CA139-281), delivered dose intensity was 38-39 mg/m2/week in both studies, with a
similar range (20-24 to 51-61).

Efficacy: The efficacy of TAXOL was evaluated by assessing cutaneous tumor response according to the amended
ACTG criteria and by seeking evidence of clinical benefit in patients in six domains of symptoms and/or conditions
that are commonly related to AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.
Cutaneous Tumor Response (Amended ACTG Criteria): The objective response rate was 59% (95% Cl: 46% to
72%) (35 of 59 patients) in patients with prior systemic therapy. Cutaneous responses were primarily defined as
flattening of more than 50% of previously raised lesions.

The median time to response was 8.1 weeks and the median duration of response measured from the first
day of treatment was 10.4 months (95% Cl: 7.0 to 11.0 months) for the patients who had previously received systemic
therapy. The median time to progression was 6.2 months (95% Cl: 4.6 to 8.7 months).
Additional Clinical Benefit: Most data on patient benefit were assessed retrospectively (plans for such analyses were
not included in the study protocols). Nonetheless, clinical descriptions and photographs indicated clear benefit in
some patients, including instances of improved pulmonary function in patients with pulmonary involvement, improved
ambulation, resolution of ulcers, and decreased analgesic requirements in patients with KS involving the feet and
resolution of facial lesions and edema in patients with KS involving the face, extremities, and genitalia.
Safety: The adverse event profile of TAXOL administered to patients with advanced HIV disease and poor-risk AIDS-
related Kaposi's sarcoma was generally consistent with that seen in the pooled analysis of data from 812 patients
with solid tumors. These adverse events and adverse events from the phase 2 second-line Kaposi's sarcoma studies
are described in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of the label, in tabular (Table 8 & 13) and narrative form. In this
immunosuppressed patient population, however, a lower dose intensity of TAXOL and supportive therapy including
hematopoietic growth factors in patients with severe neutropenia are recommended. Patients with AIDS-related
Kaposi' sarcoma may have more severe hematologic toxicities than patients with solid tumors.
11
INDICATIONS
TAXOL is indicated as first-line and subsequent therapy for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the ovary. As
first-line therapy, Taxol is indicated in combination with cisplatin.
TAXOL is indicated for the treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for
metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. Prior therapy should have included an
anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated.
TAXOL, in combination with cisplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of non-small cell
lung cancer in patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy.
TAXOL is indicated for the second-line treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
TAXOL is contraindicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reactions to TAXOL or other drugs
formulated in Cremophoro EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil).
TAXOL should not be used in patients with solid tumors who have baseline neutrophil counts of <1500
cells/mm3 or in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma with baseline neutrophi counts of <1000 cells/mm3.
WARNINGS
Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by dyspnea and hypotension requiring treatment,
angioedema, and generalized urticaria have occurred in 2-4% of patients receiving TAXOL in clinical trials. Fatal
reactions have occurred in patients despite premedication. All patients should be pretreated with corticosteroids,
diphenhydramine, and H2 antagonists. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.) Patients who experience
severe hypersensitivity reactions to TAXOL should not be rechallenged with the drug.
Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is dose-dependent and is the dose-limiting toxicity.
Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median of 11 days. TAXOL should not be administered to patients with baseline
neutrophil counts of less than 1500 cells/mm3 (<1000 cells/mm3 for patients with KS). Frequent monitoring of blood
counts should be instituted during TAXOL treatment. Patients should not be re-treated with subsequent cycles of
TAXOL until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 (>1000 cells/mm3 for patients with KS) and platelets
recover to a leve >100,000 cells/mm3.
Severe conduction abnormalities have been documented in <1% of patients during TAXOL therapy and in
some cases required pacemaker placement. If patients develop significant conduction abnormalities during TAXOL
infusion, appropriate therapy should be administered and continuous cardiac monitoring should be performed during
subsequent therapy with TAXOL.
12
Pregnancy
TAXOL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of paclitaxel during the period
of organogenesis to rabbits at doses of 3.0 mg/kg/day (about 0.2 the daily maximum recommended human dose on a
mg/m2 basis) caused embryo- and fetotoxicity, as indicated by intrauterine mortality, increased resorptions and
increased fetal deaths. Materna toxicity was also observed at this dose. No teratogenic effects were observed at 1.0
mg/kg/day (about 1/15 the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis); teratogenic potential could
not be assessed at higher doses due to extensive feta mortality.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If TAXOL is used during pregnancy,
or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to
the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.
PRECAUTIONS
Contact of the undiluted concentrate with plasticized polyviny| chloride (PVC) equipment or devices used to prepare
solutions for infusion is not recommended. In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP [di-(2-
thylhexyl)phthalate] which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, diluted TAXOL solutions should
preferably be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered
through polyethylene-lined administration sets.
TAXOL should be administered through an in-line filter with a microporous membrane not greater than 0.22
microns. Use of filter devices such as IVEX-2 filters which incorporate short inlet and outlet PVC-coated tubing has
not resulted in significant leaching of DEHP.
Drug Interactions: In a Phase 1 trial using escalating doses of TAXOL (110-200 mg/m2) and cisplatin (50 or 75
mg/m2) given as sequential infusions, myelosuppression was more profound when TAXOL was given after cisplatin
than with the alternate sequence (i.e. TAXOL before cisplatin). Pharmacokinetic data from these patients
demonstrated a decrease in paclitaxe clearance of approximately 33% when TAXOL was administered following
cisplatin.
The metabolism of TAXOL is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. In the
absence of formal clinical drug interaction studies, caution should be exercised when administering TAXOL
concomitantly with known substrates or inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. (See
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section.)
Potential interactions between paclitaxel, a substrate of CYP3A4 and protease inhibitors (ritonavir,
saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir), which are substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 have not been evaluated in
clinical trials.
13
Reports in the literature suggest that plasma levels of doxorubicin (and its active metabolite doxorubicinol)
may be increased when paclitaxel and doxorubicin are used in combination.
Hematology: TAXOL therapy should not be administered to patients with baseline neutrophil counts of less than
1,500 cells/mm3. In order to monitor the occurrence of myelotoxicity, it is recommended that frequent peripheral
blood cell counts be performed on all patients receiving TAXOL. Patients should not be re-treated with subsequent
cycles of TAXOL until neutrophils recover to a level >1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000
cells/mm3. In the case of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of TAXOL
therapy, a 20% reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy is recommended.
For patients with advanced HIV disease and poor-risk AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma TAXOL, at the
recommended dose for this disease, can be initiated and repeated if the neutrophil count is at least 1000 cells/mm3,
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to products containing
Cremophor@ EL (e.g. cyclosporin for injection concentrate and teniposide for injection concentrate) should not be
treated with TAXOL. In order to avoid the occurrence of severe hypersensitivity reactions, all patients treated with
TAXOL should be premedicated with corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone), diphenhydramine and H2
antagonists (such as cimetidine or ranitidine). Minor symptoms such as flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea,
hypotension or tachycardia do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as hypotension
requiring treatment, dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema or generalized urticaria require immediate
discontinuation of TAXOL and aggressive symptomatic therapy. Patients who have developed severe
hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with TAXOL.
Cardiovascular: Hypotension, bradycardia, and hypertension have been observed during administration of TAXOL,
but generally do not require treatment. Occasionally TAXOL infusions must be interrupted or discontinued because
of initial or recurrent hypertension. Frequent vital sign monitoring, particularly during the first hour of TAXOL infusion,
is
recommended. Continuous cardiac monitoring is not required except for patients with serious conduction
abnormalities. (See WARNINGS section.)
Nervous System: Although the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy is frequent, the development of severe
symptomatology is unusual and requires a dose reduction of 20% for all subsequent courses of TAXOL.
TAXOL contains dehydrated alcohol USP, 396 mg/mL; consideration should be given to possible CNS and
other effects of alcohol. (See PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use section.)
Hepatic: There is evidence that the toxicity of TAXOL is enhanced in patients with elevated liver enzymes. Caution
should be exercised when administering TAXOL to patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and dose
adjustments should be considered.
Injection Site Reaction: Injection site reactions, including reactions secondary to extravasation, were usually mild
and consisted of erythema, tenderness, skin discoloration or swelling at the injection site. These reactions have
14
been observed more frequently with the 24-hour infusion than with the 3-hour infusion. Recurrence of skin reactions
at a site of previous extravasation following administration of TAXOL at a different site, i.e., "recall", has been
reported rarely.
Rare reports of more severe events such as phlebitis, cellulitis, induration, skin exfoliation, necrosis and
fibrosis have been received as part of the continuing surveillance of TAXOL safety. In some cases the onset of the
injection site reaction either occurred during a prolonged infusion or was delayed by a week to ten days.
A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time. Given the possibility of
extravasation it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration.
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: The carcinogenic potential of TAXOL (paclitaxel) has not
been studied.
Paclitaxe has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro (chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes) and
in vivo (micronucleus test in mice). Paclitaxel was not mutagenic in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation
assay.
Administration of paclitaxel prior to and during mating produced impairment of fertility in male and female rats
at doses equal to or greater than 1 mg/kg/day (about 0.04 the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2
basis). At this dose, paclitaxel caused reduced fertility and reproductive indices, and increased embryo- and
fetotoxicity. (See WARNINGS SECTION.)
Pregnancy: Pregnancy "Category D." (See WARNINGS section.)
Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Following intravenous administration
of carbon-14 labeled TAXOL to rats on days 9 to 10 postpartum, concentrations of radioactivity in milk were higher
than in plasma and declined in parallel with the plasma concentrations. Because many drugs are excreted in human
milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, it is recommended that nursing be
discontinued when receiving TAXOL therapy.
Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of TAXOL in pediatric patients have not been established.
There have been reports of central nervous system (CNS) toxicity (rarely associated with death) in a clinica
trial in pediatric patients in which TAXOL was infused intravenously over 3 hours at doses ranging from 350 mg/m2 to
420 mg/m2. The toxicity is most likely attributable to the high dose of the ethanol component of the TAXOL vehicle
given over a short infusion time. The use of concomitant antihistamines may intensify this effect. Although a direct
effect of the paclitaxel itself cannot be discounted, the high doses used in this study (over twice the recommended
adult dosage) must be considered in assessing the safety of TAXOL for use in this population.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Single-Agent
15
Data in the following table are based on the experience of 812 patients (493 with ovarian carcinoma and 319 with
breast carcinoma) enrolled in 10 studies who received single-agent TAXOL. Two hundred and seventy-five patients
were treated in 8 Phase 2 studies with TAXOL doses ranging from 135 to 300 mg/m2 administered over 24 hours (in 4
of these studies, G-CSF was administered as hematopoietic support). Three hundred and one patients were treated
in the randomized Phase 3 ovarian carcinoma study which compared two doses (135 or 175 mg/m2) and two
schedules (3 or 24 hours) of TAXOL. Two hundred and thirty-six patients with breast carcinoma received TAXOL
(135 or 175 mg/m2) administered over 3 hours in a controlled study.

Myelosuppression was dose and schedule related, with the schedule effect being more prominent. The development
of severe hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) was rare; 1% of the patients and 0.2% of the courses overall. There was
no apparent dose or schedule effect seen for the HSRs. Peripheral neuropathy was clearly dose-related, but
schedule did not appear to affect the incidence.

Toxicity was generally more severe in the high dose Taxol treatment arm (T250/c75) than in the low dose Taxol arm
(T135/c75). Compared to the cisplatin/etoposide arm, patients in the low dose Taxol arm experienced more severe

As demonstrated in this table, toxicity was more pronounced in the study utilizing TAXOL at a dose of 135
mg/m2 every 3 weeks than in the study utilizing TAXOL at a dose of 100 mg/m2 every 2 weeks. Notably, severe
neutropenia (76% versus 35%), febrile neutropenia (55% versus 9%) and opportunistic infections (76% versus 54%)
were more common with the former dose and schedule. The differences between the two studies with respect to
dose escalation and use of hematopoietic growth factors, as described above, should be taken into account. (See
CLINICAL STUDIES: AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma section.) Note also that only 26% of the 85 patients in
these studies received concomitant treatment with protease inhibitors, whose effect on paclitaxel metabolism has not
yet been studied.
Narrative Discussion of Adverse Events
Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion refers to the overall safety database of 812 patients with
solid tumors treated with single-agent TAXOL in clinical studies. Toxicities that occurred with greater severity or
frequency in previously untreated patients with ovarian carcinoma or NSCLC who received TAXOL in combination
with cisplatin and that occurred with a difference that was clinically significant in this population are also described.
The frequency and severity of important adverse events for the Phase 3 first- and second-line ovarian, breast
carcinoma and NSCLC studies are presented above in tabular form by treatment arm. In addition, rare events have
been reported from the postmarketing experience or from other clinical studies. The frequency and severity of
adverse events have been generally similar for patients receiving TAXOL for the treatment of ovarian, breast, or lung
carcinoma or Kaposi's sarcoma, but patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma may have more frequent and
severe hematologic toxicity, infections, and febrile neutropenia. These patients require a lower dose intensity and
supportive care. (See CLINICAL STUDIES: AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma section.) Toxicities that were
observed only in or were noted to have occurred with greater severity in the population with Kaposi's sarcoma and
that occurred with a difference that was clinically significant in this population are described.
Hematologic: Bone marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of TAXOL. Neutropenia, the most
important hematologic toxicity, was dose and schedule dependent and was generally rapidly reversible. Among
patients treated in the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study with a 3-hour infusion, neutrophil counts declined below 500
cells/mm3 in 13% of the patients treated with a dose of 135 mg/m2 compared to 27% at a dose of 175 mg/m2 (p=0.05).
In the same study, severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was more frequent with the 24-hour than with the 3-hour
infusion; infusion duration had a greater impact on myelosuppression than dose. Neutropenia did not appear to
increase with cumulative exposure and did not appear to be more frequent nor more severe for patients previously
treated with radiation therapy.
In the study where TAXOL was administered to patients with ovarian carcinoma at a dose of 135 mg/m2/24
23
hours in combination with cisplatin versus the control arm of cyclophosphamide plus cisplatin, the incidences of grade
IV neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were significantly greater in the Taxol plus cisplatin arm than in the control
arm. Grade IV neutropenia occurred in 81% on the Taxol plus cisplatin arm versus 58% on the cyclophosphamide
plus cisplatin arm and febrile neutropenia occurred in 15% and 4% respectively. On the Taxol/cisplatin arm, there
were 35/1074 (3%) courses with fever in which Grade IV neutropenia was reported at some time during the course.
When TAXOL followed by cisplatin was administered to patients with advanced NSCLC in the ECOG
study, the incidences of Grade IV neutropenia were 74% (TAXOL 135 mg/m2/24 hours followed by
cisplatin) and 65% (TAXOL 250 mg/m2/24 hours followed by cisplatin and G-CSF) compared with 55% in
patients who received cisplatin/etoposide.
Fever was frequent (12% of all treatment courses). Infectious episodes occurred in 30% of all patients and
9% of all courses; these episodes were fatal in 1% of all patients, and included sepsis, pneumonia and peritonitis. In
the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study, infectious episodes were reported in 19% of the patients given either the 135
or 175 mg/m2 dose by a 3-hour infusion. Urinary tract infections and upper respiratory tract infections were the most
frequently reported infectious complications. In the immunosuppressed patient population with advanced HIV
disease and poor-risk AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, 61% of the patients reported at least one opportunistic
infection. (See CLINICAL STUDIES: AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma section.) The use of supportive therapy,
including G-CSF, is recommended for patients who have experienced severe neutropenia. (See DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION section.)
Thrombocytopenia was uncommon, and almost never severe (<50,000 cells/mm3). Twenty percent of the
patients experienced a drop in their platelet count below 100,000 cells/mm3 at least once while on treatment; 7% had
a platelet count <50,000 cells/mm3 at the time of their worst nadir. Bleeding episodes were reported in 4% of all
courses and by 14% of all patients but most of the hemorrhagic episodes were localized and the frequency of these
events was unrelated to the TAXOL dose and schedule. In the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study, bleeding episodes
were reported in 10% of the patients; no patients treated with the 3-hour infusion received platelet transfusions. In the
Phase 3 NSCLC study of TAXOL 135 mg/m/24 hours followed by cisplatin, severe thrombocytopenia
(<50,000/mm3) was experienced by 6% of the patients.
Anemia (Hb <11 g/dL) was observed in 78% of all patients and was severe (Hb <8 g/dL) in 16% of the
cases. No consistent relationship between dose or schedule and the frequency of anemia was observed. Among all
patients with normal baseline hemoglobin, 69% became anemic on study but only 7% had severe anemia. Red cell
transfusions were required in 25% of all patients and in 12% of those with normal baseline hemoglobin levels.
Hypersensitivity Reactions (HSRs): All patients received premedication prior to TAXOL (See WARNINGS and
PRECAUTIONS: Hypersensitivity Reactions sections). The frequency and severity of HSRs were not affected by
the dose or schedule of TAXOL administration. In the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study, the 3-hour infusion was not
associated with a greater increase in HSRs when compared to the 24-hour infusion. Hypersensitivity reactions were
24
observed in 20% of all courses and in 41% of all patients. These reactions were severe in less than 2% of the
patients and 1% of the courses. No severe reactions were observed after course 3 and severe symptoms occurred
generally within the first hour of TAXOL infusion. The most frequent symptoms observed during these severe
reactions were dyspnea flushing, chest pain and tachycardia.
The minor hypersensitivity reactions consisted mostly of flushing (28%), rash (12%), hypotension (4%),
dyspnea (2%), tachycardia (2%) and hypertension (1%). The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions remained
relatively stable during the entire treatment period.
Rare reports of chills and reports of back pain in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been
received as part of the continuing surveillance of TAXOL safety.
Cardiovascular: Hypotension, during the first 3 hours of infusion, occurred in 12% of all patients and 3% of all
courses administered. Bradycardia, during the first 3 hours of infusion, occurred in 3% of all patients and 1% of all
courses. In the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study, neither dose nor schedule had an effect on the frequency of
hypotension and bradycardia. These vital sign changes most often caused no symptoms and required neither
specific therapy nor treatment discontinuation. The frequency of hypotension and bradycardia were not influenced by
prior anthracycline therapy.
Significant cardiovascular events possibly related to single-agent TAXOL occurred in approximately 1% of
all patients These events included syncope, rhythm abnormalities hypertension and venous thrombosis. One of the
patients with syncope treated with TAXOL at 175 mg/m2 over 24 hours had progressive hypotension and died. The
arrhythmias included asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia bigeminy and complete AV block requiring pacemaker
placement. Among patients with NSCLC treated with Taxol in combination with cisplatin in the Phase 3 study,
significant cardiovascular events occurred in 12-13%. The apparent increase in these cardiovascular events is
possibly due to the difference in cardiovascular risk factors in most patients with NSCLC who were treated with Taxol
and cisplatin.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were common among patients at baseline. ECG abnormalities on
study did not usually result in symptoms, were not dose-limiting, and required no intervention. ECG abnormalities
were noted in 23% of all patients. Among patients with a normal ECG prior to study entry, 14% of all patients
developed an abnormal tracing while on study. The most frequently reported ECG modifications were non-specific
repolarization abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia and premature beats. Among patients with normal
ECGs at baseline, prior therapy with anthracyclines did not influence the frequency of ECG abnormalities.
Cases of myocardial infarction have been reported rarely. Congestive heart failure has been reported
typically in patients who have received other chemotherapy, notably anthracyclines. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug
Interactions section.)
Rare reports of atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia have been received as part of the
25
continuing surveillance of TAXOL safety.
Respiratory: Rare reports of interstitial pneumonia, lung fibrosis and pulmonary embolism, have been received as
part of the continuing surveillance of TAXOL safety. Rare reports of radiation pneumonitis have been received in
patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy.
Neurologic: The frequency and severity of neurologic manifestations were dose-dependent, but were not influenced
by infusion duration. Peripheral neuropathy was observed in 60% of all patients (3% severe) and in 52% (2%
severe) of the patients without pre-existing neuropathy.
The frequency of periphera neuropathy increased with cumulative dose. Neurologic symptoms were
observed in 27% of the patients after the first course of treatment and in 34-51% from course 2 to 10.
Peripheral neuropathy was the cause of TAXOL discontinuation in 1% of all patients. Sensory symptoms
have usually improved or resolved within several months of TAXOL discontinuation. The incidence of neurologic
symptoms did not increase in the subset of patients previously treated with cisplatin. Pre-existing neuropathies
resulting from prior therapies are not a contraindication for TAXOL therapy. In patients with NSCLC, administration of
Taxol followed by cisplatin resulted in a greater incidence of neurotoxicity compared with single-agent Taxol;
neurosensory symptoms were noted in 48% of patients receiving Taxol 135 mg/m2 by 24 hour infusion followed by
cisplatin 75 mg/m2.
Other than peripheral neuropathy, serious neurologic events following TAXOL administration have been rare
(<1%) and have included grand mal seizures syncope, ataxia and neuroencephalopathy.
Rare reports of autonomic neuropathy resulting in paralytic ileus have been received as part of the
continuing surveillance of TAXOL safety. Optic nerve and/or visua disturbances (scintillating scotomata) have also
been reported, particularly in patients who have received higher doses than those recommended. These effects
generally have been reversible. However, rare reports in the literature of abnormal visual evoked potentials in
patients have suggested persistent optic nerve damage.
ArthralgialMyalgia: There was no consistent relationship between dose or schedule of TAXOL and the frequency or
severity of arthralgia/myalgia. Sixty percent of all patients treated experienced arthralgia/myalgia; 8% experienced
severe symptoms. The symptoms were usually transient, occurred two or three days after TAXOL administration
and resolved within a few days. The frequency and severity of musculoskeletal symptoms remained unchanged
throughout the treatment period.
Hepatic: No relationship was observed between liver function abnormalities and either dose or schedule of TAXOL
administration. Among patients with normal baseline liver function 7%, 22% and 19% had elevations in bilirubin,
alkaline phosphatase and AST (SGOT), respectively. Prolonged exposure to TAXOL was not associated with
cumulative hepatic toxicity.
Rare reports of hepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy leading to death have been received as part of
26
the continuing surveillance of TAXOL safety.
Renal: Among the patients treated for Kaposi's sarcoma with TAXOL, five patients had renal toxicity of grade III or IV
severity. One patient with suspected HIV nephropathy of grade IV severity had to discontinue therapy. The other
four patients had renal insufficiency with reversible elevations of serum creatinine.
Gastrointestinal (GI) Nausealvomiting, diarrhea and mucositis were reported by 52%, 38% and 31% of all patients,
respectively. These manifestations were usually mild to moderate. Mucositis was schedule dependent and occurred
more frequently with the 24-hour than with the 3-hour infusion.
In patients with poor-risk AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, nausealvomiting, diarrhea and mucositis were
reported by 69%, 79% and 28% of patients, respectively. One-third of patients with Kaposi's sarcoma complained of
diarrhea prior to study start. (See CLINICAL STUDIES: AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma section.)
In the first-line, phase 3 ovarian carcinoma study, the incidence of nausea and vomiting when TAXOL was
administered in combination with cisplatin appeared to be greater compared with the database for single-agent
TAXOL in ovarian and breast carcinoma. In the same study, diarrhea of any grade was reported more frequently
(16%) compared to the control arm (8%) (p=0.008), but there was no difference for severe diarrhea.
Rare reports of intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, pancreatitis, ischemic colitis, and dehydration
have been received as part of the continuing surveillance of TAXOL safety. Rare reports of neutropenic enterocolitis
(typhlitis), despite the coadministration of G-CSF, were observed in patients treated with TAXOL alone and in
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.
Injection Site Reaction: Injection site reactions, including reactions secondary to extravasation, were usually mild
and consisted of erythema, tenderness, skin discoloration, or swelling at the injection site. These reactions have
been observed more frequently with the 24-hour infusion than with the 3-hour infusion. Recurrence of skin reactions
at a site of previous extravasation following administration of TAXOL at a different site, i.e., "recall", has been
reported rarely.
Rare reports of more severe events such as phlebitis, cellulitis, induration, skin exfoliation, necrosis and
fibrosis have been received as part of the continuing surveillance of TAXOL safety. In some cases the onset of the
injection site reaction either occurred during a prolonged infusion or was delayed by a week to ten days.
A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time. Given the possibility of
extravasation it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration.
Other Clinical Events: Alopecia was observed in almost all (87%) of the patients Transient skin changes due to
TAXOL related hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, but no other skin toxicities were significantly
associated with TAXOL administration. Nail changes (changes in pigmentation or discoloration of nail bed) were
uncommon (2%). Edema was reported in 21% of all patients (17% of those without baseline edema); only 1% had
severe edema and none of these patients required treatment discontinuation. Edema was most commonly focal and
27
disease-related. Edema was observed in 5% of all courses for patients with normal baseline and did not increase
with time on study.
Rare reports of skin abnormalities related to radiation recal as well as reports of maculopapular rash and
pruritus have been received as part of the continuing surveillance of TAXOL safety.
Reports of asthenia and malaise have been received as part of the continuing surveillance of TAXOL safety.
In the phase 3 trial of Taxol 135 mg/m2 over 24 hours in combination with cisplatin as first-line therapy of ovarian
cancer, asthenia was reported in 17% of patients, significantly greater than the 10% incidence observed in the
control arm of cyclophosphamide/cisplatin
Accidental Exposure: Upon inhalation, dyspnea chest pain, burning eyes, sore throat and nausea have been
reported. Following topical exposure, events have included tingling, burning and redness.
OVERDOSAGE
There is no known antidote to TAXOL overdosage. The primary anticipated complications of overdosage would
consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity and mucositis. Overdoses in pediatric patients may be
associated with acute ethanol toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use section).
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Note: Contact of the undiluted concentrate with plasticized PVC equipment or devices used to prepare solutions for
infusion is not recommended. In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP [di-(2-
ethylhexyl)phthalate], which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, diluted TAXOL solutions should be
stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through
polyethylene-lined administration sets.
All patients should be premedicated prior to TAXOL administration in order to prevent severe
hypersensitivity reactions. Such premedication may consist of dexamethasone 20 mg PO administered
approximately 12 and 6 hours before TAXOL, diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg I.V. 30 to 60 minutes prior to
TAXOL, and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg) I.V. 30 to 60 minutes before TAXOL.
For patients with carcinoma of the ovary, the following regimens are recommended:
(1)
For previously untreated patients with carcinoma of the ovary, the recommended regimen, given
every 3 weeks, is TAXOL administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg/m2
followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m2.
(2)
In patients previously treated with chemotherapy for carcinoma of the ovary, TAXOL has been used
at several doses and schedules; however, the optimal regimen is not yet clear (see CLINICAL
STUDIES: Ovarian Carcinoma section) The recommended regimen is TAXOL 135 mg/m2 or 175
28
mg/m2 administered intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks.
For patients with carcinoma of the breast, TAXOL at a dose of 175 mg/m2 administered intravenously over
3 hours every 3 weeks has been shown to be effective after failure of chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse
within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. (See CLINICAL STUDIES: Breast Carcinoma section.)
For patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma, the recommended regimen, given every 3
weeks, is TAXOL administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg/m? followed by cisplatin,
75 mg/m?.
For patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, TAXOL administered at a dose of 135 mg/m2 given
intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks or at a dose of 100 mg/m2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 2 weeks
is recommended (dose intensity 45-50 mg/m2/week). In the two clinical trials evaluating these schedules (see
CLINICAL STUDIES: AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma section), the former schedule (135 mg/m2 every 3 weeks)
was more toxic than the latter. In addition, all patients with low performance status were treated with the latter
schedule (100 mg/m2 every 2 weeks).
Based upon the immunosuppression in patients with advanced HIV disease, the following modifications are
recommended in these patients:
1) Reduce the dose of dexamethasone as one of the three premedication drugs to 10 mg PO (instead of 20
mg PO);
2) Initiate or repeat treatment with TAXOL only if the neutrophil count is at least 1000 cells/mm3;
3) Reduce the dose of subsequent courses of TAXOL by 20% for patients who experience severe
neutropenia (neutrophil <500 cells/mm3 for a week or longer); and
4) Initiate concomitant hematopoietic growth factor (G-CSF) as clinically indicated.
For the therapy of patients with solid tumors (ovary, breast, and NSCLC), courses of TAXOL should not be
repeated unti the neutrophil count is at least 1500 cells/mm3 and the platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm3.
TAXOL should not be given to patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma if the baseline or subsequent neutrophil
count is less than 1000 cells/mm3, Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil <500 cells/mm3 for
a
week or longer) or severe periphera neuropathy during TAXOL therapy should have dosage reduced by 20% for
subsequent courses of TAXOL. The incidence of neurotoxicity and the severity of neutropenia increase with dose.
Preparation and Administration Precautions: TAXOL is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, as with other potentially
toxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling TAXOL. The use of gloves is recommended. If TAXOL
solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. Following topical
exposure, events have included tingling, burning and redness. If TAXOL contacts mucous membranes, the
membranes should be flushed thoroughly with water. Upon inhalation, dyspnea, chest pain, burning eyes, sore throat
and nausea have been reported.
29
Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration
during drug administration (see PRECAUTIONS: Injection Site Reaction section).
Preparation for Intravenous Administration: TAXOL (paclitaxel) Injection must be diluted prior to infusion. TAXOL
should be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP, 5% Dextrose injection, USP, 5% Dextrose and 0.9%
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose in Ringer's Injection to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1.2 mg/mL. The
solutions are physically and chemically stable for up to 27 hours at ambient temperature (approximately 25 C) and
room lighting conditions. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and
discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.
Upon preparation, solutions may show haziness, which is attributed to the formulation vehicle. No significant
losses in potency have been noted following simulated delivery of the solution through I.V. tubing containing an in-line
(0.22 micron) filter.
Data collected for the presence of the extractable plasticizer DEHP di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate show that
levels increase with time and concentration when dilutions are prepared in PVC containers. Consequently, the use of
plasticized PVC containers and administration sets is not recommended. TAXOL solutions should be prepared and
stored in glass, polypropylene, or polyolefin containers. Non-PVC containing administration sets, such as those
which are polyethylene-lined, should be used.
TAXOL should be administered through an in-line filter with a microporous membrane not greater than 0.22
microns. Use of filter devices such as IVEX-2 filters which incorporate short inlet and outlet PVC-coated tubing has
not resulted in significant leaching of DEHP.
The
Chemo Dispensing Pin device or similar devices with spikes should not be used with vials of TAXOL
since they can cause the stopper to collapse resulting in loss of sterile integrity of the TAXOL solution.
Stability: Unopened vials of TAXOL (paclitaxel) Injection are stable until the date indicated on the package when
stored between 20 -25 C (68 -77 F), in the origina package. Neither freezing nor refrigeration adversely affects
the stability of the product. Upon refrigeration components in the TAXOL vial may precipitate, but will redissolve upon
reaching room temperature with little or no agitation There is no impact on product quality under these
circumstances. If the solution remains cloudy or if an insoluble precipitate is noted, the vial should be discarded.
Solutions for infusion prepared as recommended are stable at ambient temperature (approximately 25 C) and
lighting conditions for up to 27 hours.
